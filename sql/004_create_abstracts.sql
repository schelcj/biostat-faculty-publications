INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1,23659546,'The prevalence of hepatic steatosis may differ between post-menopausal African-American women and non-Hispanic white women and by sex hormone binding globulin level. We examined prevalence of hepatic steatosis by race/ethnicity and associations with sex hormone binding globulin.Participants included post-menopausal women who underwent hepatic ultrasound (n = 345) at the Michigan site of the Study of Women''s Health Across the Nation, a population-based study. We examined hepatic steatosis prevalence by race/ethnicity and used logistic regression models to calculate the odds of hepatic steatosis with race/ethnicity and sex hormone binding globulin, after adjustment for age, alcohol use, waist circumference, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure and use of medications reported to lower intrahepatic fat.Fewer African-American women than non-Hispanic white women had hepatic steatosis (23 vs. 36%, P = 0.01). African-American women had lower triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but higher blood pressure and follicle-stimulating hormone levels (P < 0.05). In the optimal-fitting multivariable models, women in the highest tertile of sex hormone binding globulin (60.2-220.3 nmol/l) had a lower odds of hepatic steatosis (odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.93) compared with women in the lowest tertile of sex hormone binding globulin (10.5-40.3 nmol/l). There was an interaction between race/ethnicity and medication use whereby non-Hispanic white women using medications had three times higher odds of hepatic steatosis compared with African-American women not using medications (odds ratio 3.36, 95% CI 1.07-10.58). Interactions between race/ethnicity and other variables, including sex hormone levels, were not significant.Hepatic steatosis on ultrasound may be more common in post-menopausal non-Hispanic white women than African-American women and was associated with lower levels of sex hormone binding globulin.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2,12071401,'We propose a new class of semiparametric frailty models for spatially correlated survival data. Specifically, we extend the ordinary frailty models by allowing random effects accommodating spatial correlations to enter into the baseline hazard function multiplicatively. We prove identifiability of the models and give sufficient regularity conditions. We propose drawing inference based on a marginal rank likelihood. No parametric forms of the baseline hazard need to be assumed in this semiparametric approach. Monte Carlo simulations and the Laplace approach are used to tackle the intractable integral in the likelihood function. Different spatial covariance structures are explored in simulations and the proposed methods are applied to the East Boston Asthma Study to detect prognostic factors leading to childhood asthma.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(3,19731262,'The stereotype regression model for categorical outcomes, proposed by Anderson (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. B. 1984; 46:1-30) is nested between the baseline-category logits and adjacent category logits model with proportional odds structure. The stereotype model is more parsimonious than the ordinary baseline-category (or multinomial logistic) model due to a product representation of the log-odds-ratios in terms of a common parameter corresponding to each predictor and category-specific scores. The model could be used for both ordered and unordered outcomes. For ordered outcomes, the stereotype model allows more flexibility than the popular proportional odds model in capturing highly subjective ordinal scaling which does not result from categorization of a single latent variable, but are inherently multi-dimensional in nature. As pointed out by Greenland (Statist. Med. 1994; 13:1665-1677), an additional advantage of the stereotype model is that it provides unbiased and valid inference under outcome-stratified sampling as in case-control studies. In addition, for matched case-control studies, the stereotype model is amenable to classical conditional likelihood principle, whereas there is no reduction due to sufficiency under the proportional odds model. In spite of these attractive features, the model has been applied less, as there are issues with maximum likelihood estimation and likelihood-based testing approaches due to non-linearity and lack of identifiability of the parameters. We present comprehensive Bayesian inference and model comparison procedure for this class of models as an alternative to the classical frequentist approach. We illustrate our methodology by analyzing data from The Flint Men''s Health Study, a case-control study of prostate cancer in African-American men aged 40-79 years. We use clinical staging of prostate cancer in terms of Tumors, Nodes and Metastasis as the categorical response of interest.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(4,19913101,'Despite its critical role in performance-monitoring, the development of posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pMFC) in goal-directed behaviors remains poorly understood. Performance monitoring depends on distinct, but related functions that may differentially activate the pMFC, such as monitoring response conflict and detecting errors. Developmental differences in conflict- and error-related activations, coupled with age-related changes in behavioral performance, may confound attempts to map the maturation of pMFC functions. To characterize the development of pMFC-based performance monitoring functions, we segregated interference and error-processing, while statistically controlling for performance.Twenty-one adults and 23 youth performed an event-related version of the Multi-Source Interference Task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Linear modeling of interference and error contrast estimates derived from the pMFC were regressed on age, while covarying for performance.Interference- and error-processing were associated with robust activation of the pMFC in both youth and adults. Among youth, interference- and error-related activation of the pMFC increased with age, independent of performance. Greater accuracy associated with greater pMFC activity during error commission in both groups.Increasing pMFC response to interference and errors occurs with age, likely contributing to the improvement of performance monitoring capacity during development.');

One hundred patients, >18 years old and with a body mass index > 25 and < or = 40 kg/m2, were prescribed a 1,200 to 1,500 kcal/d control diet (Group A) or an isoenergetic diet, including two meal and snack replacements (vitamin- and mineral-fortified shakes, soups, and bars) and one meal high in fruits and vegetables (Group B). Following a 3 months of weight loss, all patients were prescribed the same energy-restricted diet (1,200 to 1,500 kcal) with one meal and one snack replacement for an additional 4 years.All 100 patients were evaluated at 12 weeks. Mean percentage weight loss was 1.5 +/- 0.4% and 7.8 +/- 0.5% (mean +/- SEM) for Groups A and B, respectively. At 12 weeks systolic blood pressure, plasma triacylglycerol, glucose, and insulin concentrations were significantly reduced in Group B, whereas no changes occurred in Group A. After 4 years, 75% of the patients were evaluated. Total mean weight loss was 3.2 +/- 0.8% for Group A and 8.4 +/- 0.8% (mean +/- SEM) for Group B. Both groups showed significant improvement in blood glucose and insulin (p < 0.001), but only Group B showed significant improvement in triacylglycerol and systolic blood pressure compared to baseline values (p < 0.001).Providing a structured meal plan via vitamin- and mineral-fortified liquid meal replacements is a safe and effective dietary strategy for obese patients. Long-term maintenance of weight loss with meal replacements can improve certain biomarkers of disease risk.');

We have investigated whether DNA microarrays can identify gene expression differences between high-grade and low-grade glial tumors. We compared the transcriptional profile of 45 astrocytic tumors including 21 GBMs and 19 pilocytic astrocytomas using oligonucleotide-based microarrays. Of the approximately 6800 genes that were analyzed, a set of 360 genes provided a molecular signature that distinguished between GBMs and pilocytic astrocytomas. Many transcripts that were increased in GBM were not previously associated with gliomas and were found to encode proteins with properties that suggest their involvement in cell proliferation or cell migration. Microarray-based data for a subset of genes was validated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis also localized the protein products of specific genes of interest to the neoplastic cells of high-grade astrocytomas. Our study has identified a large number of novel genes with distinct expression patterns in high-grade and low-grade gliomas.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(7,8538168,'The ability of exogenous interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) to reverse radiation-induced defective wound healing was investigated. Mice were irradiated with 8.5 or 11 Gy to total body (TB), 12 or 16 Gy to hemibody (HB), or 20 or 26 Gy to skin alone immediately prior to surgical wounding in order to determine the effect of hematopoietic system depletion on cytokine action. A single dose of IL-1 beta or TGF-beta or vehicle control was applied to each wound. All radiation doses and types resulted in a deficit in wound healing when measured on Days 11 and 14. IL-1 beta enhanced wound tensile strength (WTS) in TB-irradiated mice, while TGF-beta enhanced WTS in HB-irradiated mice. Neither cytokine was effective at enhancing WTS in unirradiated or skin-only irradiated animals. In addition IL-1 beta and TGF-beta showed distinct differences in their effects on the kinetics of healing with time after wounding. The effects of TGF-beta appeared to be transient with compromise of the gain in WTS. The differences in the effects of these two cytokines in affecting wound healing reflect their involvement in different cellular events in the wound healing process.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(8,1467514,'The Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome, or its molecular counterpart, the BCR-ABL fusion gene, is a rare but important prognostic indicator in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but its impact on adult ALL has not been well ascertained. A prospective study of the BCR-ABL fusion gene was begun on patients entered on clinical trials conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). All patients received intensive, multiagent chemotherapy that included daunorubicin. Over 2 years, 56 patients were studied for molecular evidence of a BCR-ABL gene using Southern blot and pulsed-field gel hybridization analysis. Results were compared with cytogenetic detection of a Ph1 chromosome, and clinical features were compared for the BCR-ABL-positive and -negative groups. Molecular methods detected the BCR-ABL gene in 30% of cases compared with cytogenetic detection of the Ph1 chromosome in only 23%. The majority of cases (76%) showed the p190 gene subtype similar to pediatric ALL; the BCR-ABL-positive cases displayed a more homogeneous immunophenotype than the BCR-ABL-negative cases and were predominantly CALLA positive (86%) and B-cell surface antigen positive (82%). The rate of achieving complete remission was similar in the BCR-ABL-positive and -negative groups (71% and 77%, respectively, P = .72). There were more early relapses in the BCR-ABL-positive group, resulting in a shorter remission duration that was especially marked in the CALLA-positive and B-cell antigen-positive populations. These preliminary data suggest that the impact of the BCR-ABL gene on clinical outcome in ALL may be on maintenance of complete remission (CR) rather than achievement of CR when aggressive, multiagent chemotherapy is used. This study identifies the BCR-ABL gene as an important factor in adult ALL and demonstrates the utility of molecular methods for its accurate diagnosis.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(9,12853639,'Optimization of probe design for array-based experiments requires improved predictability of oligonucleotide hybridization behavior. Currently, designing oligonucleotides capable of interacting efficiently and specifically with the relevant target is not a routine procedure. Multiple examples demonstrate that oligonucleotides targeting different regions of the same RNA differ in their hybridization ability. The present work shows how thermodynamic evaluations of oligo-target duplex or oligo self-structure stabilities can facilitate probe design. Statistical analysis of large sets of hybridization data reveals that thermodynamic evaluation of oligonucleotide properties can be used to avoid poor RNA binders. Thermodynamic criteria for the selection of 20 and 21mers, which, with high probability, interact efficiently and specifically with their targets, are suggested. The design of longer oligonucleotides can also be facilitated by the same calculations of DeltaG(o) (T) values for oligo-target duplex or oligo self-structure stabilities and similar selection schemes.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(10,23760615,'Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is an often lethal complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Clinical severity correlates with outcomes, but histopathologic grading is primarily used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. One barrier to using histopathologic grading to predict clinical outcomes is inter-grader variability among transplant centers. Recent experimental models have shown that the loss of Paneth cells, which are located in the small intestine and help regulate the GI microbiome by secreting antimicrobial peptides, correlates with clinical GVHD severity. Because Paneth cells are easy to identify and quantify by light microscopy, we evaluated the mean number of Paneth cells per high-powered field (hpf) in 116 duodenal biopsies obtained at diagnosis of GI GVHD at 2 different centers with their clinical outcomes. Paneth cell counts were reproducible between centers (r(2) = 0.81; P < .0001). Lower numbers of Paneth cells at diagnosis correlated with clinically more severe GI GVHD (P < .0001) and less likelihood of response to GVHD treatment (P < .0001). A threshold of 4 Paneth cells per hpf stratified patients according to nonrelapse mortality (28% vs 56%; P = .004). We conclude that the enumeration of duodenal Paneth cells is a readily available index of disease severity that provides important information regarding GVHD prognosis.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(11,17890495,'The objective was to provide an overall assessment of genetic linkage data of BMI and BMI-defined obesity using a nonparametric genome scan meta-analysis.We identified 37 published studies containing data on over 31,000 individuals from more than >10,000 families and obtained genome-wide logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores, non-parametric linkage (NPL) scores, or maximum likelihood scores (MLS). BMI was analyzed in a pooled set of all studies, as a subgroup of 10 studies that used BMI-defined obesity, and for subgroups ascertained through type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or subjects of European ancestry.Bins at chromosome 13q13.2- q33.1, 12q23-q24.3 achieved suggestive evidence of linkage to BMI in the pooled analysis and samples ascertained for hypertension. Nominal evidence of linkage to these regions and suggestive evidence for 11q13.3-22.3 were also observed for BMI-defined obesity. The FTO obesity gene locus at 16q12.2 also showed nominal evidence for linkage. However, overall distribution of summed rank p values <0.05 is not different from that expected by chance. The strongest evidence was obtained in the families ascertained for hypertension at 9q31.1-qter and 12p11.21-q23 (p < 0.01).Despite having substantial statistical power, we did not unequivocally implicate specific loci for BMI or obesity. This may be because genes influencing adiposity are of very small effect, with substantial genetic heterogeneity and variable dependence on environmental factors. However, the observation that the FTO gene maps to one of the highest ranking bins for obesity is interesting and, while not a validation of this approach, indicates that other potential loci identified in this study should be investigated further.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(12,3414688,'In designing a study to demonstrate the existence of a major locus for a quantitative trait, an investigator chooses a sampling rule to ascertain pedigrees. The choice of sampling rule can significantly affect the study''s power. Here, we compare two types of sampling rules for family studies: fixed-structure rules, in which the same set of relatives are sampled for each proband, and sequential rules, in which the relative or relatives to be sampled next may depend on the trait values of the individuals already observed. We compare fixed-structure and sequential sampling in the setting of extended pedigrees, a quantitative trait, and the genetic mixed model. Using computer simulation, we show that sequential sampling can increase power to detect segregation at a dominant major locus by over 60% in comparison with fixed-structure sampling. Just as important, this substantially increased power is obtained with an easily implemented sampling rule, one that might reasonably be employed in a family study of a quantitative trait.');

All available FDR were directly interviewed blind to proband status; parents were also interviewed to assess the family psychiatric history of FDR and SDR. Best-estimate diagnoses were made using all sources of information. Data were analyzed with logistic regression and robust Cox regression models.Lifetime MDD prevalence was significantly higher in case than in control FDR (30.4 versus 15.4%). Lifetime MDD prevalence was significantly higher in FDR of case probands with MDD than in FDR of case probands without MDD or control FDR (46.3 versus 19.7 versus 15.4%, respectively). MDD in case FDR was significantly associated with MDD in case probands and with age and OCD in those relatives. Lifetime MDD prevalence was similar in case and control SDR. However, lifetime MDD prevalence was significantly higher in SDR of case probands with MDD than in SDR of case probands without MDD or control SDR (31.9 versus 16.8 versus 15.4%, respectively).MDD prevalence was significantly higher in both FDR and SDR of case probands with MDD than in relatives of case probands without MDD or control relatives, suggesting that pediatric OCD comorbid with MDD is a complex familial syndrome.');

To date, the order of DNA markers mapped within this region has been based on genetic linkage analysis. We report the use of multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization to establish a physically based map of five polymorphic DNA markers and 10 cloned genes spanning this region. Three cosmid clones and Alu-PCR-generated products derived from 12 yeast artificial chromosome clones representing each of these markers were used in two-color mapping experiments to determine an initial proximity of markers relative to each other on metaphase chromosomes. Interphase mapping was then employed to determine the order and orientation of closely spaced loci by direct visualization of fluorescent signals following hybridization of three probes, each detected in a different color. Statistical analysis of the combined data suggests that the order of markers in the BRCA1 region is cen-THRA1-TOP2-GAS-OF2-17HSD-248yg9-RNU 2-OF3-PPY/p131-EPB3-Mfd188- WNT3-HOX2-GP3A-tel.

We examined the one-year changes in lipids among postmenopausal, prediabetic women in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), and whether changes were mediated by sex hormones.We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of 342 women who used HT at baseline and year 1 and 382 women who did not use HT at either time point. Interventions included intensive lifestyle (ILS) with goals of weight reduction of at least 7% of initial weight and 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise, or metformin or placebo administered 850 mg up to twice a day. Women were not randomized to HT. Main outcome measures were changes between baseline and study year 1 in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides.Compared to placebo, both ILS and metformin significantly reduced LDL-C and raised HDL-C among HT users, changes partially explained by change in estradiol and testosterone but independent of changes in waist circumference and 1/fasting insulin. In contrast, DPP interventions had no effect on LDL-C and HDL-C among non-HT users. ILS significantly lowered triglycerides among non-users but did not significantly change triglycerides among HT users.

We identify clinical parameters that would improve our ability to select patients for this imaging study.We reviewed all bone scintigrams done at our institution between 1991 and 1996 in patients with persistently increasing serum PSA after radical prostatectomy. What prompted the clinician to obtain the bone scintigram was trigger PSA (tPSA). The rate of increase in PSA to tPSA was measured by tPSA/time from radical prostatectomy (slope 1) and tPSA/time from last undetectable PSA (slope 2). These parameters were evaluated together with standard clinicopathological data in univariate and multivariate analyses to determine the ability to predict the bone scintigram result.In univariate analysis tPSA (p = 0.003), slope 1 (p = 0.005) and slope 2 (p = 0.004) were useful in predicting the bone scintigram result but pathological stage, Gleason score, preoperative PSA and time to recurrence were not. In multivariate analysis the single most useful parameter in predicting the bone scintigram result was tPSA (p = 0.01). Based on a logistic regression model the probability of a positive bone scintigram was less than 5% until tPSA increased to 40 to 45 ng./ml.In patients with increasing serum PSA after radical prostatectomy current serum PSA is the best predictor of the bone scintigram result.

Subjects included 244 dentists (47.4%) and 269 non-dentists (52.2%; mostly dental hygienists and dental assistants). The mean mercury levels in urine (1.06 Î¼g/L) and hair (0.51 Î¼g/g) were not significantly different from the US general population (0.95 Î¼g/L and 0.47 Î¼g/g, respectively). In multivariate linear models predicting nerve function adjusting for covariates, only 3 out of a total of 504 models showed stable and statistically significant interaction of SNPs with mercury biomarkers.

An elevated summary SMR was observed in cohorts exposed to amphibole asbestos (summary SMR = 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.00), but not in cohorts exposed to serpentine asbestos (summary SMR = 1.04; 95% CI 0.81-1.33) or in cohorts exposed to both serpentine and amphibole asbestos (summary SMR = 1.03; 95% CI 0.74-1.42).

After stratifying the cohorts based on mortality due to all cancers excluding those known or suspected to be associated with asbestos exposure, lung cancer mortality was not clearly associated with colorectal cancer mortality, suggesting that the crude association between these factors may be due to misdiagnosis of lung cancer as other types of cancer in the reported causes of death. These results suggest that exposure to amphibole asbestos may be associated with colorectal cancer, but these findings may reflect an artifact of miscertification of cause of death.

Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to assess relative risk (RR) for mortality and hospitalization for patients administered water-soluble vitamins versus those not administered water-soluble vitamins.There was large variation by region in the percentage of patients administered water-soluble vitamins: Europe ranged from a low of 3.7% in the United Kingdom to a high of 37.9% in Spain; 5.6% in Japan; and 71.9% in the United States. Patient use of water-soluble vitamins was associated with a substantially and significantly lower risk for mortality (RR, 0.84; P = 0.001). Lower RR for facility-level mortality also was associated with greater water-soluble vitamin use (RR, 0.98; P = 0.05 per 10% more patients administered water-soluble vitamins at the facility).Although only a randomized trial could prove that water-soluble vitamins improve outcomes, use of water-soluble vitamins is a minimal-risk practice pattern associated with improved outcomes in this prospective observational study.');

The volumetric distribution of portal venous perfusion in the whole liver was estimated for each scan. We assessed the correlation between mean portal venous perfusion in the nontumor volume of the liver and overall liver function measured by ICG before, during, and after RT. The dose response for regional portal venous perfusion to RT was determined using a linear mixed effects model.There was a significant correlation between the ICG clearance rate and mean portal venous perfusion in the functioning liver parenchyma, suggesting that portal venous perfusion could be used as a surrogate for function. Reduction in regional venous perfusion 1 month after RT was predicted by the locally accumulated biologically corrected dose at the end of RT (P<.0007). Regional portal venous perfusion measured during RT was a significant predictor for regional venous perfusion assessed 1 month after RT (P<.00001). Global hypovenous perfusion pre-RT was observed in 4 patients (3 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis), 3 of whom had recovered from hypoperfusion, except in the highest dose regions, post-RT. In addition, 3 patients who had normal perfusion pre-RT had marked hypervenous perfusion or reperfusion in low-dose regions post-RT.This study suggests that MR-based volumetric hepatic perfusion imaging may be a biomarker for spatial distribution of liver function, which could aid in individualizing therapy, particularly for patients at risk for liver injury after RT.');

Haplotype analysis was carried out, including calculation of the probability that the observed data would have been obtained if the underlying cause of primary open-angle glaucoma in this family were a defect in a gene located in the tested interval. Linkage analysis was carried out under an autosomal dominant model for GLC1A glaucoma.In family UM:POAG1, primary open-angle glaucoma was diagnosed in six surviving and one deceased member of a sibship of 13 individuals during the fifth or sixth decade of life. Glaucoma in this family has a later average age at diagnosis and significantly less elevation in intraocular pressure than GLC1A glaucoma so far described. Haplotype analysis, using a population prevalence up to 0.9%, shows that it is unlikely that the reported data would have been observed if primary open-angle glaucoma in this pedigree were due to the GLC1A locus on chromosome 1q21-q31. Linkage analysis under the juvenile glaucoma autosomal dominant model allowed exclusion of linkage across the entire GLC1A genetic inclusion interval, with a maximum lod score in the interval of -3.28.The most likely interpretation of these observations is that a defect in the GLC1A glaucoma gene is not responsible for adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma in family UM:POAG1. This suggests the existence of at least two primary open-angle glaucoma genes, the previously reported GLC1A gene on chromosome 1q and another gene located elsewhere in the genome. Diagnosis of UM:POAG1 glaucoma between 42 and 57 years of age also raises questions regarding the relation of the glaucoma present in this family to the common later-age-onset form of the disease.');

Cox regression was used to compare covariate-adjusted mortality among five RRT categories: transplant-naive dialysis, cadaveric primary renal transplant, living-donor primary renal transplant, post-GF dialysis and retransplant. RRT category-specific hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox regression and adjusting for age, sex, race, calendar period, primary renal diagnosis and comorbid conditions.Mortality among post-GF dialysis patients was approximately equal to that of transplant-naive patients (HR = 0.90; P = 0.30) while the HR for retransplanted patients was significantly decreased, relative to the transplant-naive group (HR = 0.35; P<0.01). Diabetes was found to be a significantly (P<0.01) stronger mortality risk factor among post-GF dialysis patients (HR = 3.71) compared with the transplant-naive group (HR = 1.73).

As several recent studies have demonstrated, technical confounding factors such as batch effects can complicate eQTL analysis by causing many spurious associations including spurious regulatory hotspots. Yet little is understood about how these technical confounding factors affect eQTL analyses and how to correct for these factors. Our analysis of data sets with biological replicates suggests that it is this intersample correlation structure inherent in expression data that leads to spurious associations between genetic loci and a large number of transcripts inducing spurious regulatory hotspots. We propose a statistical method that corrects for the spurious associations caused by complex intersample correlation of expression measurements in eQTL mapping. Applying our intersample correlation emended (ICE) eQTL mapping method to mouse, yeast, and human identifies many more cis associations while eliminating most of the spurious trans associations. The concordances of cis and trans associations have consistently increased between different replicates, tissues, and populations, demonstrating the higher accuracy of our method to identify real genetic effects.');

Given the multitude of pathways through which the treatment or risk factor may affect the outcome, there is also an interest in decomposing the effect of a treatment of risk factor into "direct" and "mediated" effects. For example, child''s socioeconomic status (risk factor) may have a direct effect on the risk of death (outcome) and an effect that may be mediated through the adulthood socioeconomic status (mediator). Building on the potential outcome framework for causal inference, we develop a Bayesian approach for estimating direct and mediated effects in the context of a dichotomous mediator and dichotomous outcome, which is challenging as many parameters cannot be fully identified. We first define principal strata corresponding to the joint distribution of the observed and counterfactual values of the mediator, and define associate, dissociative, and mediated effects as functions of the differences in the mean outcome under differing treatment assignments within the principal strata. We then develop the likelihood properties and calculate nonparametric bounds of these causal effects assuming randomized treatment assignment. Because likelihood theory is not well developed for nonidentifiable parameters, we consider a Bayesian approach that allows the direct and mediated effects to be expressed in terms of the posterior distribution of the population parameters of interest. This range can be reduced by making further assumptions about the parameters that can be encoded in prior distribution assumptions. We perform sensitivity analyses by using several prior distributions that make weaker assumptions than monotonicity or the exclusion restriction. We consider an application that explores the mediating effects of adult poverty on the relationship between childhood poverty and risk of death.');

Study population included 71 eligible patients who had 3 successive rising PSA levels or a minimum PSA of 10 ng/ml at 2 successive evaluations prior to starting therapy. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a tomato extract capsule containing 15 mg of lycopene alone (n = 38) or together with a capsule containing 40 mg of a soy isoflavone mixture (n = 33) twice daily orally for a maximum of 6 mo. One patient on the lycopene arm did not receive therapy due to his inability to ingest the study pill. There was no decline in serum PSA in either group qualifying for a partial or complete response.

In new studies reported here the specificity of this receptor complex for binding hexokinase is defined, and a purification scheme is described which leads to a homogeneous and bindable form of the tumor hexokinase. In the AS-30D hepatoma, hexokinase activity is elevated more than 100-fold relative to liver tissue. The relative increase in hexokinase activity is 8 times greater than that of any other glycolytic enzyme. Hexokinase is the only glycolytic enzyme of AS-30D cells to exhibit a mitochondrial/cytoplasmic specific activity ratio greater than 1, showing a 3.5-fold elevation in the mitochondrial fraction. Purification of hexokinase is accomplished by preferential solubilization of the mitochondrial bound enzyme with glucose-6-phosphate, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography on gel permeation and anion exchange columns. The final fraction has a specific activity of 144 units per mg of protein, with a Km for glucose of 0.13 mM and for ATP of 1.4 mM. The purified tumor enzyme migrates as a single species upon sodium dodecyl sulfate: polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of 98,000. Significantly, the purified tumor enzyme retains its activity for mitochondrial binding.

We evaluate the methods in terms of integrated Type I error and power, averaged with respect to varying scenarios for gene-environment association that are likely to appear in practice. These unique studies suggest that the novel EB procedure overall is a promising approach for detection of gene-environment interactions from case-control studies. In particular, the EB procedure, unlike the case-only or two-step methods, can closely maintain a desired Type I error under realistic scenarios of gene-environment dependence and yet can be substantially more powerful than the traditional case-control analysis when the gene-environment independence assumption is satisfied, exactly or approximately. Our studies also reveal potential utility of some non-traditional case-control designs that samples controls at a smaller rate than the cases.

Estimates of doses to achieve local control in 50% of cases (TCD50) were made from published local control rates, and the dependence of these doses on overall treatment duration was evaluated. In parallel, published scattergrams were analyzed to estimate the rate of tumor regrowth over the period of 4-10 weeks from initiation of therapy. Both analyses suggested that, on average, clonogen repopulation in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck accelerates only after a lag period of the order of 4 +/- 1 weeks after initiation of radiotherapy and that a dose increment of about 0.6 Gy per day is required to compensate for this repopulation. Such a dose increment is consistent with a 4-day clonogen doubling rate, compared with a median of about 60 days in published reports of unperturbed tumor growth rates.

This paper is concerned with regression analysis of epidemiologic data where a binary exposure is subject to pooling and the pooled measurement is dichotomized to indicate either that no subjects in the pool are exposed or that some are exposed, without revealing further information about the exposed subjects in the latter case. The pooling process may be stratified on the disease status (a binary outcome) and possibly other variables but is otherwise assumed random. We propose methods for estimating parameters in a prospective logistic regression model and illustrate these with data from a population-based case-control study of colorectal cancer. Simulation results show that the proposed methods perform reasonably well in realistic settings and that pooling can lead to sizable gains in cost efficiency. We make recommendations with regard to the choice of design for pooled epidemiologic studies.');

Our purpose is to investigate the relationship between radiation dose and saliva changes in the 2 years after treatment.The study population includes 142 patients treated with conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Saliva flow rates from 266 parotid glands are measured before and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. Measurements are collected separately from each gland under both stimulated and unstimulated conditions. Bayesian nonlinear hierarchical models were developed and fit to the data.Parotids receiving higher radiation produce less saliva. The largest reduction is at 1-3 months after RT followed by gradual recovery. When mean doses are lower (e.g., <25 Gy), the model-predicted average stimulated saliva recovers to pretreatment levels at 12 months and exceeds it at 18 and 24 months. For higher doses (e.g., >30 Gy), the stimulated saliva does not return to original levels after 2 years. Without stimulation, at 24 months, the predicted saliva is 86% of pretreatment levels for 25 Gy and <31% for >40 Gy. We do not find evidence to support that the overproduction of stimulated saliva at 18 and 24 months after low dose in 1 parotid gland is the result of low saliva production from the other parotid gland.Saliva production is affected significantly by radiation, but with doses <25-30 Gy, recovery is substantial and returns to pretreatment levels 2 years after RT.');

Measures of psychosocial functioning were derived from scales measuring cynical hostility, hopelessness, and depressive symptoms.Men with both parents who had less than a primary school education or who both had unskilled manual jobs had higher age-adjusted levels of cynical hostility, hopelessness, and depressive symptoms in adulthood. Mutually adjusted analyses showed that parents'' education and the respondents'' education, occupation, and income all had statistically independent effects on adult levels of cynical hostility and hopelessness. For instance, men for whom neither parent had completed primary education had a 0.15 standard deviation (P = 0.006) higher cynical hostility score, and a 0.20 standard deviation (P = 0.00018) higher hopelessness score, after adjustment for education, occupation and income.

However, nearly all diseases mapped to date follow clear Mendelian, single-locus segregation patterns. In contrast, many common familial diseases such as diabetes, psoriasis, several forms of cancer, and schizophrenia are familial and appear to have a genetic component but do not exhibit simple Mendelian transmission. More complex models are required to explain the genetics of these important diseases. In this paper, we explore two-trait-locus, two-marker-locus linkage analysis in which two trait loci are mapped simultaneously to separate genetic markers. We compare the utility of this approach to standard one-trait-locus, one-marker-locus linkage analysis with and without allowance for heterogeneity. We also compare the utility of the two-trait-locus, two-marker-locus analysis to two-trait-locus, one-marker-locus linkage analysis. For common diseases, pedigrees are often bilineal, with disease genes entering via two or more unrelated pedigree members. Since such pedigrees often are avoided in linkage studies, we also investigate the relative information content of unilineal and bilineal pedigrees. For the dominant-or-recessive and threshold models that we consider, we find that two-trait-locus, two-marker-locus linkage analysis can provide substantially more linkage information, as measured by expected maximum lod score, than standard one-trait-locus, one-marker-locus methods, even allowing for heterogeneity, while, for a dominant-or-dominant generating model, one-locus models that allow for heterogeneity extract essentially as much information as the two-trait-locus methods. For these three models, we also find that bilineal pedigrees provide sufficient linkage information to warrant their inclusion in such studies. We also discuss strategies for assessing the significance of the two linkages assumed in two-trait-locus, two-marker-locus models.');

Personal exposure and indoor measurements had similar determinants, which depended on the VOC. Gasoline-related VOCs (e.g., benzene, methyl tertiary butyl ether) were associated with city, residences with attached garages, self-pumping of gas, wind speed, and house air exchange rate (AER). Odorant and cleaning-related VOCs (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene and chloroform) also were associated with city and AER, and with house size and family members showering. Dry-cleaning and industry-related VOCs (e.g., tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene) were associated with city, residence water supply type, and dry-cleaner visits. These and other relationships were significant, explained from 10 to 40% of the variation, and are consistent with known emission sources and the literature.

Comparison groups were HIV-seronegative homosexual men, HIV-seronegative heterosexual men, and homosexual HIV-1-infected men who were long-term non-progressors.Three-color immunofluorescence and monoclonal antibodies were used to assess HIV-1-induced lymphocyte subset alterations related to immune deficiency and immune activation. Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were monitored to assess suppression of viral replication.CD4+ cell counts significantly increased and lymphocyte activation measured as CD38 and HLA-DR expression on CD8+ T cells significantly decreased by 48 weeks. CD4+ cell values remained abnormal even in those who were fully suppressed. Some T-cell activation markers decreased to levels observed in long-term non-progressors. The increase in CD4+ T-cell numbers reached a plateau by week 24, but the increase in resting HLA-DR- CD38-T cells was sustained through week 48. Proportions of CD45RA+ CD62L-selectin+ and CD28+ CD4+ T-cell subsets and Fas expression were not abnormal at baseline compared with seronegative homosexual controls.The most significant impact of suppression of viral replication was reversal of T-cell activation. However, normalization of lymphocyte subset perturbations associated with chronic HIV-1 infection was not achieved after 1 year of treatment with current combination antiretroviral regimens. More profound viral suppression, therapy for longer than 1 year, or immunologic augmentation may be needed to fully reverse the abnormalities.');

In the allogeneic group (n = 21), six patients received bone marrow and 15 received G-CSF mobilized PBSC; all autologous patients (n = 35) received PBSC mobilized with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF. Allogeneic donors were HLA-identical (n = 20) or one-antigen mismatched (n = 1) siblings. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus (n = 10), tacrolimus/methotrexate (n = 6), cyclosporine/methotrexate (n = 4), or cyclosporine (n = 1). The groups were evenly matched for gender, pretransplant therapy, disease status at time of transplant, myeloma subtype, and time from diagnosis to transplant. The median age was significantly lower in the allogeneic group (48 vs 55 years, P < 0.01). In the allogeneic group the probabilities of developing acute GVHD grade II-IV and chronic GVHD were 55% and 82%, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier probability of disease progression was significantly lower in the allogeneic group (11% vs 64%, P < 0.001) compared to the autologous group. Although progression-free (60% vs 30%, P = 0.19) and overall survival at 2 years (60% vs 42%, P = 0.39) favored the allogeneic group, this did not reach statistical significance. Within the allogeneic transplant group, patients age 50 years or under had a 3-year overall survival significantly higher when compared to older patients (79% vs 29%, P = 0.03). Using identical preparative regimens, allogeneic transplantation reduced disease progression compared to autologous transplantation for myeloma.

We selected 11 loci for further genotyping in stage 2 samples of 931 case and 783 control subjects. The joint effect of stage 1 plus stage 2 studies was analyzed by meta-analysis. We also investigated the effect of known type 2 diabetes variants in GDM. Two loci known to be associated with type 2 diabetes had a genome-wide significant association with GDM in the joint analysis. rs7754840, a variant in CDKAL1, had the strongest association with GDM (odds ratio 1.518; P=6.65Ã10(-16)). A variant near MTNR1B, rs10830962, was also significantly associated with the risk of GDM (1.454; P=2.49Ã10(-13)).

The patients were followed for 1 year. The primary outcome was a radiographic linear measurement of alveolar bone level. Secondary outcomes included clinical variables, bone turnover markers in serum and oral fluid, systemic bone mineral density, and quality of life.Radiographic linear resolution of osseous defects was significantly greater after teriparatide therapy than after placebo beginning at 6 months, with a mean linear gain in bone at 1 year of 29% as compared with 3% (P<0.001). Clinical improvement was greater in patients taking teriparatide than in those taking placebo, with a reduction in periodontal probing depth of 33% versus 20% (2.42 mm vs. 1.32 mm) and a gain in clinical attachment level of 22% versus 7% (1.58 mm vs. 0.42 mm) in target lesions at 1 year (P = 0.02 for both comparisons). No serious adverse events were reported; however, the number of patients in the study was small.

Cox regression models were used to examine the relationship of variables to the risk of graft failure.Ninety-day and 1-year graft survival were 87% and 81%, respectively. Fifty-one (13.2%) grafts failed in the first 90 days. The most common causes of graft failure were vascular thrombosis, primary nonfunction, and sepsis. Biliary complications were common (30% early, 11% late). Older recipient age and length of cold ischemia were significant predictors of graft failure. Center experience greater than 20 ALDLT was associated with a significantly lower risk of graft failure. Recipient Model for End-stage Liver Disease score and graft size were not significant predictors.This multicenter A2ALL experience provides evidence that ALDLT is a viable option for liver replacement.

Statistical adjustments were made for patient demographics, comorbidities, dose of dialysis (Kt/V), and body size. Europe and Japan had significantly longer (P < 0.0001) average TT than the US (232 and 244 min vs 211 in DOPPS I; 235 and 240 min vs 221 in DOPPS II).

Two additional cohorts were used for replication studies. Standard genetic-association methods were used to analyze the results for association with disease and interaction with other loci.Coding SNPs in TLR3 (rs3775291) and TLR7 (rs179008) showed association with AMD in one group (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively) before correction for multiple testing.

The two coding SNPs were not associated with AMD in another case-control cohort or an extended-family cohort. Although an intronic SNP in TLR4 was associated marginally with AMD (P = 0.03), it was not possible to replicate a previous association with the rare coding SNP D299G in this gene (P = 0.6).Although borderline support for association between polymorphisms in TLR genes and AMD was reported for some cohorts, these initial observations of coding SNPs in TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 were not replicated.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(87,24060439,'This study resulted in a model-averaging methodology that predicts crash injury risk using vehicle, demographic, and morphomic variables and assesses the importance of individual predictors. The effectiveness of this methodology was illustrated through analysis of occupant chest injuries in frontal vehicle crashes. The crash data were obtained from the International Center for Automotive Medicine (ICAM) database for calendar year 1996 to 2012. The morphomic data are quantitative measurements of variations in human body 3-dimensional anatomy. Morphomics are obtained from imaging records. In this study, morphomics were obtained from chest, abdomen, and spine CT using novel patented algorithms. A NASS-trained crash investigator with over thirty years of experience collected the in-depth crash data. There were 226 cases available with occupants involved in frontal crashes and morphomic measurements. Only cases with complete recorded data were retained for statistical analysis. Logistic regression models were fitted using all possible configurations of vehicle, demographic, and morphomic variables. Different models were ranked by the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). An averaged logistic regression model approach was used due to the limited sample size relative to the number of variables. This approach is helpful when addressing variable selection, building prediction models, and assessing the importance of individual variables. The final predictive results were developed using this approach, based on the top 100 models in the AIC ranking. Model-averaging minimized model uncertainty, decreased the overall prediction variance, and provided an approach to evaluating the importance of individual variables. There were 17 variables investigated: four vehicle, four demographic, and nine morphomic. More than 130,000 logistic models were investigated in total. The models were characterized into four scenarios to assess individual variable contribution to injury risk. Scenario 1 used vehicle variables; Scenario 2, vehicle and demographic variables; Scenario 3, vehicle and morphomic variables; and Scenario 4 used all variables. AIC was used to rank the models and to address over-fitting. In each scenario, the results based on the top three models and the averages of the top 100 models were presented. The AIC and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were reported in each model. The models were re-fitted after removing each variable one at a time. The increases of AIC and the decreases of AUC were then assessed to measure the contribution and importance of the individual variables in each model. The importance of the individual variables was also determined by their weighted frequencies of appearance in the top 100 selected models. Overall, the AUC was 0.58 in Scenario 1, 0.78 in Scenario 2, 0.76 in Scenario 3 and 0.82 in Scenario 4. The results showed that morphomic variables are as accurate at predicting injury risk as demographic variables. The results of this study emphasize the importance of including morphomic variables when assessing injury risk. The results also highlight the need for morphomic data in the development of human mathematical models when assessing restraint performance in frontal crashes, since morphomic variables are more "tangible" measurements compared to demographic variables such as age and gender.');

Patients excluded were those with N1 or M1 disease, those treated after radical prostatectomy, those who received hormone therapy before radiation therapy, and those who died, failed clinically, or had no PSA response in the first 6 months after RT. Patients included were required to have a minimum of 2 post-RT PSAs separated by at least 1 week. Biochemical relapse was defined as 3 consecutive PSA rises. This resulted in 154 patients with biochemical failure. Survival was calculated from the third PSA elevation. The rate of rise of PSA was calculated by fitting a regression line to the four rising PSAs on a ln PSA vs. time plot.There were 41 deaths among the 154 patients with failure in 23 of the 41 due to prostate cancer. The overall survival after failure was 58% at 5 years, while the cause-specific failure was 73% at 5 years. Among the 154 failures, several factors were evaluated for an association with overall survival: age at failure, pre-RT PSA, PSA at second rise, PSA nadir, time from RT to failure, time to nadir, Gleason score, T-stage, and rate of rise, both from the nadir and from the beginning of the rise. None of these factors were significantly associated with an increased risk of death. As expected, the group of patients with biochemical failure have significantly worse prognostic factors than those without biochemical failure: median pre-RT PSA 15.9 vs. 9.0 (p < 0.001), and Gleason score of 7 or greater for 48% of subjects vs. 40% (p = 0.1). Relative PSA rise and slope of ln PSA vs. time were associated with cause-specific mortality (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively).Overall survival after conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer remains high 5 years after biochemical failure. This high survival rate occurs even though the group of patients with biochemical failure has worse than average adverse preradiation prognostic factors.

Both isoforms of glucose-regulated M(r) 58,000 protein were found to be significantly correlated with their mRNA expression profiles (P < 0.05), indicating that increased transcription likely underlies the increased expression of these proteins.Two-dimensional PAGE and mass spectrometry can identify proteins showing increased expression in lung adenocarcinoma.

Effects on survival were evaluated according to age, stage, tumor site, tumor size, grade, axillary lymph node status, extent of surgery, and radiotherapy (RT). A multivariate model was used with complete data on 45,880 patients. The median follow-up was 59 months.Patients with outer tumor location demonstrated superior BCSS on Kaplan-Meier analysis for both local stage (node-negative, P <.001) and regional stage disease (node-positive, P =.0002). For BCSS, the hazard ratio (HR) for inner quadrant location compared with outer quadrant was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 1.37; P <.001); and for OS, the HR was 1.12 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.17; P <.001). When ER and PR status were included in the model, the HR for inner quadrant location compared with outer quadrant was 1.27 for BCSS (95% CI, 1.16 to 1.40; P <.001) and 1.11 for OS (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.19; P =.004).

Cancer incidence rates among heart transplant patients were compared to those of the general population. The observed number of incident cancers was 160 with 58.9 expected in the general population (SIR = 2.7, 95% CI = 2.3, 3.2).

Descriptive statistics were used to report differences over time in the four quality assurance parameters along with erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) and intravenous iron doses. Time trends were analyzed using linear mixed models adjusted for patient demographics and comorbidities. The proportion of patients with short treatment times (less than 4âh) and low spKt/V (below 1.2) improved throughout the study and was lowest after implementation of quality assurance. Hemoglobin levels have increased since 1998 and remained consistent since 2005, with only 8-10% of patients below 10âg/dl. About 90% of patients were prescribed ESAs, with the dose declining since peaking in 2006. Intravenous iron use was highest in 2011.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified 157 variants associated with lipid levels but are not well suited to assess the impact of rare and low-frequency variants. To determine whether rare or low-frequency coding variants are associated with LDL-C, we exome sequenced 2,005 individuals, including 554 individuals selected for extreme LDL-C (>98(th) or <2(nd) percentile). Follow-up analyses included sequencing of 1,302 additional individuals and genotype-based analysis of 52,221 individuals. We observed significant evidence of association between LDL-C and the burden of rare or low-frequency variants in PNPLA5, encoding a phospholipase-domain-containing protein, and both known and previously unidentified variants in PCSK9, LDLR and APOB, three known lipid-related genes. The effect sizes for the burden of rare variants for each associated gene were substantially higher than those observed for individual SNPs identified from GWASs. We replicated the PNPLA5 signal in an independent large-scale sequencing study of 2,084 individuals.

In a subset (n = 78), we monitored indoor and outdoor levels simultaneously with the personal monitoring during the second trimester with an identical monitor. The subset of women was also monitored for personal exposure for a 48-hr period during each trimester. We repeatedly administered a questionnaire on health history, lifestyle, and home environment.The observed personal, indoor, and outdoor B(a)P levels we observed in Krakow far exceed the recommended Swedish guideline value for B(a)P of 0.1 ng/m(3). Based on simultaneously monitored levels, the outdoor PAH level alone accounts for 93% of total variability in personal exposure during the heating season. Living near the Krakow bus depot, a crossroad, and the city center and time spent outdoors or commuting were not associated with higher personal exposure. During the nonheating season only, a 1-hr increase in environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure was associated with a 10-16% increase in personal exposure to the nine measured PAHs. A 1 degrees C decrease in ambient temperature was associated with a 3-5% increase in exposure to benz[a]anthracene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene, after accounting for the outdoor concentration. A random effects model demonstrated that mean personal exposure at a given gestational period depends on the season, residence location, and ETS.Considering that most women reported spending < 3 hr/day outdoors, most women in the study were exposed to outdoor-originating PAHs within the indoor setting. Cross-sectional, longitudinal monitoring supplemented with questionnaire data allowed development of a gestation-length model of individual-level exposure with high precision and validity. These results are generalizable to other nonsmoking pregnant women in similar exposure settings and support reduction of exposure to protect the developing fetus.');

To investigate these issues, we followed for 4 years 943 Joslin Clinic patients aged 15-44 years with type 1 diabetes who had normoalbuminuria during the 2-year baseline period. Microalbuminuria developed in 109 of the 943 individuals, giving an incidence rate of 3.3/100 person-years. The risk of onset of microalbuminuria was predicted somewhat more precisely by the measurements during the 1st and 2nd years preceding onset than by all the measurements during the longer (4-year) interval, suggesting attenuation of the impact of past hyperglycemia over time. Point estimates of the incidence rate (per 100 person-years) according to quartiles of HbA(1c) during the 1st and 2nd years preceding the outcome were 1.3 in the 1st, 1.5 in the 2nd, 3.1 in the 3rd, and 6.9 in the 4th (P = 1.3 x 10(-9)). Point estimates of the incidence rate (per 100 person-years) according to smoking status were 7.9 for current smokers, 1.8 for past smokers, and 2.2 for those who had never smoked (P = 2.0 x 10(-7)). In a multiple logistic model, the independent effects of HbA(1c) level and cigarette smoking remained highly significant, but their magnitudes were reduced. Using the same covariates in a generalized additive model, we examined the shape of the relationship between HbA(1c) and onset of microalbuminuria and found significant nonlinearity in the logarithm of odds scale (P = 0.04). The slope was steeper with HbA(1c) >8% than <8%. Furthermore, the change in the slope was magnified among current smokers.

Shape differences were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, using both landmark-based morphometrics and traditional distance measurements. Mice fed a gruel made of laboratory chow soaked in water differed from those fed hard blocks of chow by a slight anterior shift in the incisor tips, a narrowed zygomatic plate, a reduction in size of the masseteric tubercles, an overall decrease in skull size in lateral view, and an increase in overall size in ventral view.

Family informant data were collected on another 450 individuals without direct interviews, forming two data sets with one contained within the other. Complex segregation analyses were performed using regressive models as programmed in REGTL in the S.A.G.E. package. All models used in the analyses included sex-specific age and type parameters.All models that excluded a residual effect of an affected parent were rejected. With that parameter included, the environmental and sporadic models were rejected in comparisons with the most general model in both data sets (all p < 0.005). With the direct interview data, the general codominant Mendelian model was not rejected when compared with the most general model (p = 0.140). We could not distinguish between any of the simple Mendelian models using either data set. However, the dominant Mendelian model provided a somewhat better fit than the other Mendelian models to the direct interview data.The results provide evidence for a major susceptibility locus in families with OCD when age at onset is incorporated into the model. Mendelian factors at most partially explained the familial aggregation of the phenotype, and residual familial effects were necessary to fit the data adequately. The results support the importance of linkage efforts by suggesting that a major locus is segregating within a proportion of families with OCD ascertained through pediatric probands.');

There are two predominant theories as to the underlying mechanism of clonus. The prevailing one is that clonus results from recurrent activation of stretch reflexes. An alternative hypothesis is that clonus results from the action of a central oscillator. We present evidence that the mechanism underlying clonus in individuals with SCI is not solely related to muscle stretch. We studied electromyography (EMG) of the soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG), tibialis anterior (TA), medial and lateral hamstrings, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and rectus femoris from subjects with clinically complete and clinically incomplete SCI during stretch-induced ankle clonus, stepping, and non-weight-bearing standing. Clonic EMG of the SOL, MG, and TA occurred synchronously and were not consistently related to muscle-tendon stretch in any of the conditions studied. Further, EMG activity during stretch-induced ankle clonus, stepping, and non-weight-bearing standing had similar burst frequency, burst duration, silent period duration, and coactivation among muscles, indicating that clonic EMG patterns occurred over a wide range of kinematic and kinetic conditions, and thus proprioceptive inputs. These results suggest that the repetitive clonic bursts could not be attributable solely to immediate afferent feedback such as recurrent muscle stretch.

Since it has been established that cells of fetal origin can be found in maternal tissues long after parturition, and cells of maternal origin may persist for years in offspring, we hypothesized that this fetal-maternal microchimerism may confer tolerance and thus less graft loss for kidneys transplanted between mothers and their offspring.We used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to compare death-censored graft survival among recipients of living-related renal transplants sharing at least one human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype with their donor. A total of 23,064 such transplants were reported from 1995 to 2004. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to compare death-censored graft survival among the following donor-recipient pairings: child-to-mother, child-to-father, mother-to-child, father-to-child, 1-haplotype matched siblings, and HLA-identical siblings.HLA-identical sibling recipients had the best survival, but results for the child-to-father group were not significantly worse (hazard ratio=1.07, P=0.47). Mother-to-child transplants had the poorest graft survival (hazard ratio=2.61, P<0.0001). We found no evidence of tolerance to kidneys transplanted between mothers and offspring.Our analysis of 1-haplotype matched living-related renal transplants argues against tolerance to organs based on fetal-maternal microchimerism.

The clinical features in this family were compared with those seen in other pedigrees with this condition. Linkage analysis was performed to evaluate whether a glaucoma-causing gene in UM:JG3 is linked to genetic markers on chromosome 1q.Affected family members, their siblings, children, and spouses were examined to identify the presence of glaucoma. Linkage studies were performed using short tandem repeat polymorphisms from chromosome 1q. Results of these studies were compared with those found for other families in which juvenile-onset primary open-angle glaucoma is linked genetically to the same chromosome 1q region.The UM:JG3 family includes 22 affected individuals over five generations, including 12 still living. The average age at diagnosis for living affected individuals was 26 years. An association between myopia and glaucoma was observed in this family, but the glaucoma was not associated with iris processes or other structural anomalies. The clinical course of disease and response to treatment were similar to other families with this disease. The disease phenotype in this family is linked to markers on chromosome 1q with a maximum lod score of 3.52 at a recombination fraction of 0.00 for marker D1S433. Haplotype analysis suggests the gene responsible for glaucoma in this family is located in an 8-cM region between markers D1S445 and D1S218.The glaucoma in UM:JG3 is linked to markers on chromosome 1q, with a candidate interval smaller than that in previous reports. In individuals with juvenile-onset open-angle glaucoma linked to chromosome 1q, the phenotype can range from mild ocular hypertension to blindness, resulting from marked elevations in intraocular pressure, with age at diagnosis ranging from 6 to 62 years.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(133,19381255,'With the development of high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies, the number of markers collected in genetic association studies is growing rapidly, increasing the importance of methods for correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. The permutation test is widely considered the gold standard for accurate multiple testing correction, but it is often computationally impractical for these large datasets. Recently, several studies proposed efficient alternative approaches to the permutation test based on the multivariate normal distribution (MVN). However, they cannot accurately correct for multiple testing in genome-wide association studies for two reasons. First, these methods require partitioning of the genome into many disjoint blocks and ignore all correlations between markers from different blocks. Second, the true null distribution of the test statistic often fails to follow the asymptotic distribution at the tails of the distribution. We propose an accurate and efficient method for multiple testing correction in genome-wide association studies--SLIDE. Our method accounts for all correlation within a sliding window and corrects for the departure of the true null distribution of the statistic from the asymptotic distribution. In simulations using the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data, the error rate of SLIDE''s corrected p-values is more than 20 times smaller than the error rate of the previous MVN-based methods'' corrected p-values, while SLIDE is orders of magnitude faster than the permutation test and other competing methods.

Triglyceride levels in the carriers were 39% lower than levels in noncarriers (P<1Ã10(-20)), and circulating levels of APOC3 in carriers were 46% lower than levels in noncarriers (P=8Ã10(-10)). The risk of coronary heart disease among 498 carriers of any rare APOC3 mutation was 40% lower than the risk among 110,472 noncarriers (odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.75; P=4Ã10(-6)).Rare mutations that disrupt APOC3 function were associated with lower levels of plasma triglycerides and APOC3.

AMD is associated with a diverse spectrum of clinical phenotypes, all of which include the death of photoreceptors in the central part of the human retina (called the macula). Tremendous progress has been made in identifying genetic susceptibility variants for AMD. Variants at chromosome 1q32 (in the region of CFH) and 10q26 (LOC387715/ARMS2) account for a large part of the genetic risk to AMD and have been validated in numerous studies. In addition, susceptibility variants at other loci, several as yet unidentified, make substantial cumulative contribution to genetic risk for AMD; among these, multiple studies support the role of variants in APOE and C2/BF genes. Genome-wide association and re-sequencing projects, together with gene-environment interaction studies, are expected to further define the causal relationships that connect genetic variants to AMD pathogenesis and should assist in better design of prevention and intervention.');

Three phosphorylated forms and one unphosphorylated form of the Op18 protein were identified and found to be overexpressed in lung adenocarcinomas as compared with normal lung. The percentage of phosphorylated to total Op18 protein isoforms increased from 3.2% in normal lung to 7.9% in lung tumors. Both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Op18 proteins were significantly increased in poorly differentiated tumors as compared with moderately or well differentiated lung adenocarcinomas (p<0.03), suggesting that up-regulated expression of Op18 reflects a poor differentiation status and higher cell proliferation rates. This was further verified in A549 and SKLU1 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines by examining Op18 levels and phosphorylation status following treatment that altered either cell proliferation or differentiation. The increased expression of Op18 protein was significantly correlated with its mRNA level indicating that increased transcription likely underlies elevated expression of Op18. The overexpression of Op18 proteins in poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinomas and the elevated expression of the phosphorylated forms of Op18 may offer a new target for drug- or gene-directed therapy and may have potential utility as a tumor marker.');

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(148,7836089,'To determine the dose-response relationship for elective treatment of subclinical metastatic deposits and validate a model for metastatic tumor cell burden.The incidence of overt metastases in electively irradiated potential sites of spread from carcinomas of the head and neck, breast, cervix, ovary, lung, and testis, and from melanomas and osteosarcomas, was compared with the incidence in patients not receiving elective irradiation. The reduction in incidence of metastases was analyzed as a function of radiation dose.The dose-response curve for control of subclinical metastases is linear and shallow, and extrapolates to a dose intercept not demonstrably different from zero. A small threshold may reflect growth of residual micrometastases between treatment for the primary and elective irradiation. The shallow linear dose response reflects interpatient heterogeneity in metastatic tumor cell burden, ranging from 1 to M cells, where M is the upper limit of clinical undetectability. While a dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions is necessary to achieve an overall 90% reduction in the incidence of metastases, the metastatic cell burden in a proportion of patients can be eliminated by low doses. Thus, worthwhile rates of control can still be achieved when "tolerance" dictates lower than optimal doses, evidenced by the linearity and lack of significant threshold in the dose-response curve. This is an important difference from treatment of gross disease. The biological effectiveness of elective treatment is measured directly by the percent reduction in failure rate. Although it depends upon the log cell kill, it relates only to that proportion of patients harboring subclinical disease, and, therefore, is not well described by the increase in the cure rate for the total patient population. The linear dose-response relationship for reduction in failure rate is independent of the "natural" (untreated) incidence of subclinical metastasis, and, therefore, of site, histology, growth rate, stage, or other characteristics of the tumor. Conversely, the clinical effectiveness of elective treatment is measured by increase in tumor control rate and depends upon the "natural" incidence of metastasis: the higher it is, the greater the absolute increase in cure rate from a constant biological effect (log cell kill).(a) High control rates for subclinical metastases require doses of about 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, but worthwhile benefits can be achieved by lower doses if necessitated by reduced tolerance; (b) elective treatment of subclinical metastases should be instituted close to the time of treatment of the primary; (c) the biological effectiveness of elective radiation (or chemotherapy) should be measured by the percentage decrease in metastasis, not by improvements in the rate of control; and (d) demonstration of success in clinical trials of adjuvant therapy is more likely the higher the incidence of metastases in untreated controls.');

Our method considers both linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and the constraints imposed by family structure when assigning individual genotypes and haplotypes. Using simulations, we show that trios provide higher genotype calling accuracy across the frequency spectrum, both overall and at hard-to-call heterozygous sites. In addition, trios provide greatly improved phasing accuracy--improving the accuracy of downstream analyses (such as genotype imputation) that rely on phased haplotypes. To further evaluate our approach, we analyzed data on the first 508 individuals sequenced by the SardiNIA sequencing project.

Survival also appears to be decreased among obese liver transplant recipients. Based on these findings, some authors have argued against kidney or liver transplantation in the morbidly obese. However, the survival benefit for patients listed for and receiving either a kidney or liver transplant is not well understood. To determine if a significant survival benefit exists for obese patients after transplantation versus those on the waiting list, we studied a retrospective cohort of patients identified in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database. Adjusted, time-dependent Cox regression models were used to evaluate the relative risk (RR) of death after transplantation compared with waiting list mortality for either kidney or liver transplantation. These results demonstrate that kidney transplantation offers a significant survival benefit and is the preferred therapy for most obese dialysis patients. Although liver transplant recipients with a BMI > or = 35 kg/m2 had an increased RR for mortality compared with other recipients with a lower BMI, all groups, regardless of BMI, demonstrated a significant transplant benefit.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(160,23553326,'When an outcome of interest in a clinical trial is late-occurring or difficult to obtain, surrogate markers can extract information about the effect of the treatment on the outcome of interest. Understanding associations between the causal effect (CE) of treatment on the outcome and the causal effect of treatment on the surrogate is critical to understanding the value of a surrogate from a clinical perspective.Traditional regression approaches to determine the proportion of the treatment effect explained by surrogate markers suffer from several shortcomings: they can be unstable and can lie outside the 0-1 range. Furthermore, they do not account for the fact that surrogate measures are obtained post randomization, and thus, the surrogate-outcome relationship may be subject to unmeasured confounding.to avoid these problems are of key importance. Methods Frangakis and Rubin suggested assessing the CE within prerandomization ''principal strata'' defined by the counterfactual joint distribution of the surrogate marker under the different treatment arms, with the proportion of the overall outcome CE attributable to subjects for whom the treatment affects the proposed surrogate as the key measure of interest. Li et al. developed this ''principal surrogacy'' approach for dichotomous markers and outcomes, utilizing Bayesian methods that accommodated nonidentifiability in the model parameters. Because the surrogate marker is typically observed early, outcome data are often missing. Here, we extend Li et al. to accommodate missing data in the observable final outcome under ignorable and nonignorable settings. We also allow for the possibility that missingness has a counterfactual component, a feature that previous literature has not addressed.We apply the proposed methods to a trial of glaucoma control comparing surgery versus medication, where intraocular pressure (IOP) control at 12 months is a surrogate for IOP control at 96 months. We also conduct a series of simulations to consider the impacts of nonignorability, as well as sensitivity to priors and the ability of the decision information criterion (DIC) to choose the correct model when parameters are not fully identified.Because model parameters cannot be fully identified from data, informative priors can introduce nontrivial bias in moderate sample size settings, while more noninformative priors can yield wide credible intervals.Assessing the linkage between CEs of treatment on a surrogate marker and CEs of a treatment on an outcome is important to understanding the value of a marker. These CEs are not fully identifiable; hence, we explore the sensitivity and identifiability aspects of these models and show that relatively weak assumptions can still yield meaningful results.');

Tissue repair cells (TRCs) isolated from bone marrow represent a mixed stem and progenitor population enriched in CD90- and CD14-positive cells. In this phase I/II, randomized, controlled feasibility trial, we investigated TRC cell therapy to reconstruct localized craniofacial bone defects. Twenty-four patients requiring localized reconstruction of jawbone defects participated in this longitudinal trial. For regenerative therapy, patients were randomized to receive either guided bone regeneration (GBR) or TRC transplantation. At 6 or 12 weeks following treatment, clinical and radiographic assessments of bone repair were performed. Bone biopsies were harvested and underwent quantitative micro-computed tomographic (Î¼CT) and bone histomorphometric analyses. Oral implants were installed, subsequently restored, and functionally loaded with tooth restorations. Reconstructed sites were assessed for 1 year following therapy. No study-related, serious adverse events were reported. Following therapy, clinical, radiographic, tomographic, and histological measures demonstrated that TRC therapy accelerated alveolar bone regeneration compared to GBR therapy. Additionally, TRC treatment significantly reduced the need for secondary bone grafting at the time of oral implant placement with a five fold decrease in implant bony dehiscence exposure (residual bone defects) as compared to GBR-treated sites(p < 0.01). Transplantation of TRCs for treatment of alveolar bone defects appears safe and accelerates bone regeneration, enabling jawbone reconstruction with oral implants. The results from this trial support expanded studies of TRC therapy in the treatment of craniofacial deformities (ClinicalTrials.gov number CT00755911).');

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effects of CTD compared with HCTZ on cardiovascular event (CVE) rates. We performed a retrospective observational cohort study from the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial data set from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial was a cardiovascular primary prevention trial where participants were men 35 to 57 years of age enrolled and followed beginning in 1973. CVEs were measured yearly, and time to event was assessed by Cox regression. Systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, potassium, glucose, and uric acid were measured yearly. The difference between groups was evaluated by repeated-measures mixed modeling, and each model was adjusted for predictors of each variable. CVEs were significantly lower in those on CTD (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.43 to 0.61]; P<0.0001) and on HCTZ (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.55 to 0.75]; P<0.0001) compared with those who took neither drug. When comparing the 2 drugs, CTD had significantly fewer CVEs compared with HCTZ (P=0.0016). CTD displayed significantly lower SBP (P<0.0001), lower total cholesterol (P<0.0001), lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.0009), lower potassium (P=0.0003), and higher uric acid (P<0.0001) over time compared with HCTZ. In conclusion, both HCTZ and CTD reduce CVEs compared with neither drug. When comparing both drugs, CTD reduces CVEs more than HCTZ, suggesting that CTD may be the preferred thiazide-type diuretic for hypertension in patients at high risk of CVEs.');

Our analysis supports a requirement for one chiasma per chromosome rather than per arm to ensure proper disjunction, with additional chiasmata occurring in proportion to physical length. The requirement is not absolute, however, as chromosome 21 seems to be frequently transmitted properly in the absence of a chiasma in females, a finding that raises the possibility of a back-up mechanism aiding in its correct segregation. We also found a set of double crossovers in surprisingly close proximity, as expected from a second pathway that is not subject to crossover interference.

Fine mapping, conditional analyses, and exome array genotyping in 8,635 individuals from the Metabolic Syndrome in Men study confirmed a single major association signal between fasting proinsulin and noncoding variants (p = 7.4 Ã 10(-50)). Measurement of allele-specific mRNA levels in human pancreatic islet samples heterozygous for rs11603334 showed that the T2D-risk and proinsulin-decreasing allele (C) is associated with increased ARAP1 expression (p < 0.02). We evaluated four candidate functional SNPs for allelic effects on transcriptional activity by performing reporter assays in rodent pancreatic beta cell lines. The C allele of rs11603334, located near one of the ARAP1 promoters, exhibited 2-fold higher transcriptional activity than did the T allele (p < 0.0001); three other candidate SNPs showed no allelic differences. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated decreased binding of pancreatic beta cell transcriptional regulators PAX6 and PAX4 to the rs11603334 C allele. Collectively, these data suggest that the T2D-risk allele of rs11603334 could abrogate binding of a complex containing PAX6 and PAX4 and thus lead to increased promoter activity and ARAP1 expression in human pancreatic islets.

The linkage study included 40 members of 1 branch of the family in which juvenile-onset POAG is segregating in an autosomal-dominant pattern. Mutation screening included 15 at-risk family members with juvenile-onset POAG, probands of 40 families with adult-onset POAG, probands of 11 additional unrelated juvenile-onset POAG families, and 43 unrelated normal control subjects.Clinical and family history records were obtained, ophthalmologic examinations were performed, and blood samples were drawn for use in genotyping.Allele sizes of microsatellite repeat genetic markers from the vicinity of the GLC1A glaucoma gene on chromosome 1q were assigned based on size fractionation of DNA fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Linkage was established by the method of lod scores. Mutations were identified by determination of the DNA sequence of PCR products amplified from the trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response (TIGR) gene. Glaucoma status for purposes of linkage and mutation analysis was based on a combination of ophthalmologic examination, clinical records, family history, and previously published information. For some individuals reported in the pedigree, but not included in the genotyping studies, less information was available as presented in the text and tables.Autosomal-dominant POAG was confirmed or reported for 78 members of an 8-generation family. Linkage analysis showed significant evidence for linkage of juvenile-onset POAG in one branch of the family to D1S452 (maximum lod score of 6.42 at a recombination fraction of 0.00) and other markers in the vicinity of the GLC1A gene on chromosome 1q. Screening of the TIGR gene identified a mutation that results in substitution of asparagine for isoleucine at codon 477 near the carboxyterminal end of the protein.The authors'' findings strongly suggest that the juvenile-onset POAG locus in this family is the GLC1A locus and that the underlying cause of the disease is the IIe477Asn TIGR mutation that cosegregates with juvenile-onset POAG in one branch of this large family. Lack of samples from deceased individuals prevented the authors from determining whether reported adult-onset cases in this family could also be attributed to the IIe477Asn TIGR mutation.

A plot of the design on an nd2 versus nd graph is suggested, and this graph is called the design plot.

Furthermore, dose points with expected response probabilities outside the range 0.1 to 0.9 contribute negligibly to the efficiency with which alpha/beta can be estimated.

In addition, from a statistical viewpoint, it makes no difference whether a single large top-up dose or several smaller top-up doses are used; however, other considerations suggest that two or more top-up doses may be preferable.

Progression to AD is differentially predicted by symptom profiles reported at the age of first symptom onset, with persons reporting Cluster C symptoms most likely to progress subsequently to AD.

Answers to such questions might not always reflect the true prevalences of health conditions (for example, if a respondent misreports height/weight or does not have access to a doctor or other health professional). Such ''measurement error'' in health data could affect inferences about measures of health and health disparities.

Models predicting clinical values from self-reported values and covariates are fitted to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which asks self-report questions during an interview component and also obtains clinical measurements during a physical examination component. The fitted models are used to multiply impute clinical values for the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a larger survey that obtains data solely via interviews. Illustrations involving hypertension, diabetes, and obesity suggest that estimates of health measures based on the multiply imputed clinical values are different from those based on the NHIS self-reported data alone and have smaller estimated standard errors than those based solely on the NHANES clinical data. The paper discusses the relationship of the methods used in the study to two-phase/two-stage/validation sampling and estimation, along with limitations, practical considerations, and areas for future research.');

Acute respiratory conditions were reported by survey respondents and separated into five subgroups: colds, influenza, nasopharyngitis, otitis media, and lower respiratory infections. Allergic conditions and chronic respiratory disorders (tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumoconioses) were excluded. The subgroupings of acute respiratory conditions appear to separate the disorders in a manner consistent with the epidemiologic characteristics of each condition. About one-half (50.4 percent) of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population had one or more acute respiratory conditions during 1980. The highest rates for upper respiratory conditions (colds, influenza, nasopharyngitis, and otitis media) were reported for those under 18 years of age, and rates were lower in successively older groups. Lower respiratory infection rates were higher in the youngest and oldest groups. Despite a high incidence in the general population, most symptomatic episodes of colds, influenza, and nasopharyngitis did not result in ambulatory care visits or hospital admissions. Otitis media and lower respiratory infections were more often associated with medical visits. Acute respiratory conditions were associated with lower disability levels than the average for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population during 1980 (5.9 restricted-activity days for acute respiratory conditions, compared with an overall average of 13.8 restricted-activity days). Persons with upper respiratory conditions (colds, influenza, otitis media, and nasopharyngitis) averaged 2.3 to 5.4 restricted-activity days, but persons with lower respiratory infections experienced an average of 8.2 restricted-activity days. Indirect costs attributed to acute respiratory conditions in 1980 were $7.7 billion for employed persons and $698 million for homemakers, for a total of $8.4 billion, about the same as total direct costs ($8.3 billion). These indirect costs were several times larger than the annual indirect costs estimated for either cardiovascular diseases or musculoskeletal diseases, two common chronic or recurrent condition groups. The high indirect costs reflect the high frequency of episodes in the general population during 1980 and the greater likelihood of associated bed-disability and work-loss days than for other conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)');

"Change" was defined as a difference between two successive interval slopes. Sixty-two percent of seroconverters meeting these criteria experienced a shift in one or more of their successive CD4+ interval slopes, the majority (56%) from a level slope to a negative slope (decreasing numbers of CD4+ cells), a significantly greater proportion than that observed among seronegatives (30%, p less than 0.0001). Fifty-eight percent of the seropositives maintained level interval slopes over the 3 years of follow-up. The majority (59%) of those men experiencing a shift went from a level to a negative interval slope, a significantly greater proportion than observed among seronegatives (30%, p less than 0.0001). The observed patterns of change in interval slopes are consistent with the laboratory observation that CD4+ cells must be activated to replicate HIV-1.

This same biological process may also be measured by W, coming from a prior technology but correlated with X. On a moderately sized sample, we have (Y,X,W), and on a larger sample we have (Y,W). We utilize the data on W to boost the prediction of Y by X. When p is large and the subsample containing X is small, this is a p>n situation. When p is small, this is akin to the classical measurement error problem; however, ours is not the typical goal of calibrating W for use in future studies. We propose to shrink the regression coefficients Î² of Y on X toward different targets that use information derived from W in the larger dataset. We compare these proposals with the classical ridge regression of Y on X, which does not use W. We also unify all of these methods as targeted ridge estimators. Finally, we propose a hybrid estimator which is a linear combination of multiple estimators of Î². With an optimal choice of weights, the hybrid estimator balances efficiency and robustness in a data-adaptive way to theoretically yield a smaller prediction error than any of its constituents.

Here, we show that reduction of CCN6 expression occurs in 60% of invasive breast carcinomas and is associated with axillary lymph node metastases. Furthermore, low CCN6 expression in invasive carcinoma tissue samples correlates with reduced expression of E-cadherin. In vitro, RNA interference knockdown of CCN6 in two benign human mammary epithelial cell lines (HME and MCF10A) decreased expression of E-cadherin protein and mRNA and reduced activity of the E-cadherin promoter; this reduction was dependent on intact E-box elements. CCN6 knockdown in HME cells resulted in up-regulation of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors Snail and ZEB1 and enhanced their recruitment and binding to the E-cadherin promoter as analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of ZEB1 or Snail blocked the down-regulation of E-cadherin caused by CCN6 inhibition. These data show, for the first time, that CCN6 expression is reduced or lost in a substantial number of invasive breast carcinomas and that CCN6 modulates transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin. Together, our results lead to a new hypothesis that Snail and ZEB1 are downstream of CCN6 and play a critical role in CCN6-mediated regulation of E-cadherin in breast cancer.');

(1) A functional subunit (FSU) may be defined structurally (e.g. as in a nephron), or only functionally, as the largest unit of cells capable of being regenerated from a surviving clonogenic cell without loss of the specified function. (2) Functional subunits may be arranged in parallel or in series: in parallel they give rise to graded dose responses, whereas in series, they give rise to threshold binary, or quantum responses. (3) Tolerance doses are a function of the number and radiosensitivity of target cells in an FSU, tissue organization and the functional reserve (i.e. the proportion of functional subunits necessary for adequate organ function). (4) An influence of treatment volume on "tolerance" doses is more likely to depend upon tissue organization than upon differences in cellular radiosensitivity. (5) The volume of tissue irradiated would be expected to be irrelevant to the "tolerance" of tissues showing a graded dose response (e.g. skin desquamation), except when the injury becomes severe, when tolerance for a large severe wound is likely to be less than for a small volume of injury, for non-radiobiological reasons. (6) Tissues with FSU''s arranged in series, for example, spinal cord or peritoneal sheath along small bowel, should show a threshold-binary response. Sigmoid dose response curves should have a lower threshold and be steeper the larger the treatment volume. The effect of increase in volume is greatest with changes in small volumes: once a large number of FSU''s are being irradiated, a further increase in volume has little effect on the position or slope of the probability curve for such complications. (7) Because their sigmoid dose-response curves are step, threshold-binary tissues are sensitive to small increases in "biologically effective" dose. For example, when the spinal cord is treated with large dose fractions the biological effectiveness per unit of dose increases sharply.

It is quite possible that the covariates add to, rather than multiply the baseline hazard, making an additive hazards model a more suitable choice. Typically, proportionality is assumed, with the potential for additive covariate effects not evaluated or even seriously considered.

In the HMDP, a GWA of total body, spinal, and femoral BMD revealed four significant associations (-log10P>5.39) affecting at least one BMD trait on chromosomes (Chrs.) 7, 11, 12, and 17. The associations implicated a total of 163 genes with each association harboring between 14 and 112 genes. This list was reduced to 26 functional candidates by identifying those genes that were regulated by local eQTL in bone or harbored potentially functional non-synonymous (NS) SNPs. This analysis revealed that the most significant BMD SNP on Chr. 12 was a NS SNP in the additional sex combs like-2 (Asxl2) gene that was predicted to be functional. The involvement of Asxl2 in the regulation of bone mass was confirmed by the observation that Asxl2 knockout mice had reduced BMD. To begin to unravel the mechanism through which Asxl2 influenced BMD, a gene co-expression network was created using cortical bone gene expression microarray data from the HMDP strains. Asxl2 was identified as a member of a co-expression module enriched for genes involved in the differentiation of myeloid cells. In bone, osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells of myeloid origin, suggesting that Asxl2 may play a role in osteoclast differentiation. In agreement, the knockdown of Asxl2 in bone marrow macrophages impaired their ability to form osteoclasts.

Stratification of 29 HIV seroconverters showed a strong inverse correlation between the serum neopterin rise and the blood CD4 T cell fall in the first year following HIV infection. Thus, a small increase in neopterin (less than 5 nmol/L) at the time of HIV seroconversion was associated with minimal CD4 T cell reduction and a large increase (greater than 12 nmol/L) was associated with a much greater CD4 T cell fall. Neopterin levels were markedly different (lower) in individuals with little or no CD4 T cell fall when compared with those with moderate or marked rates of T cell fall. This relationship between serum neopterin and the CD4 T cell level was further confirmed by an evaluation of both parameters in a group of 799 seropositive homosexual men.

We show that this optimal test outperforms burden tests and SKAT in a wide range of scenarios. The results are illustrated using simulation studies and triglyceride data from the Dallas Heart Study. In addition, we have derived sample size/power calculation formula for SKAT with a new family of kernels to facilitate designing new sequence association studies.');

We present conditions in which race/ethnicity is and is not an independent predictor of survival outcomes.We examined the conditions of age, stage and year of diagnosis, and the role of race/ethnicity on disease-free survival in men who underwent consecutive radical prostatectomy as monotherapy from 1990 to 1999. Data were collected from 229 AAMs and 562 white American men prospectively in the Karmanos Cancer Institute Prostate cancer data bases.When the majority of the cohort had pathologically organ confined disease, race/ethnicity was not an independent predictor of disease-free survival. When the majority of the cohort had a mean age of 70 years or greater, race/ethnicity was not an independent predictor. In studies done in the late 1990s, when the stage of radical prostatectomy cases had shifted toward pathologically organ confined disease as the dominant stage, race/ethnicity was not an independent predictor. However, if the cohort was diagnosed at younger age and/or with more advanced prostate cancer, race/ethnicity became an independent predictor. In the early 1990s there was pathologically advanced disease in the majority of our cohort.Race/ethnicity as an independent predictor of prostate cancer is conditional and dependent on age, stage and year of diagnosis. Year of diagnosis is associated with a stage shift to earlier staged prostate cancer from the early to late 1990s. In general, study cohorts are often subranges of the entire spectrum of prostate cancer that are limited by these factors, especially stage at diagnosis and treatment. If diagnosed and treated early enough, although there is evidence suggesting that AAMs have more aggressive disease biologically, the role of race as a factor in outcome is significantly decreased.

The small bowel and colon of 170 IL-10 null mice, 31 Min +/- mice, and 120 Min +/-/IL-10 null mice were examined microscopically.The number of flat adenomas was increased in the colons of the Min +/-/IL-10-/- mice, compared with the Min +/- mice (P = .0005). Neither colitis-type dysplasia nor carcinoma was increased in the Min +/-/IL-10 -/-, compared with the IL-10 null mice (P = .18). Mice deficient in IL-10 developed colitic-type dysplasia (P = .0001) or carcinoma (P = .0001) correlated with increasing inflammation.Breeding the Min +/- genotype into the IL-10 -/- background increased the incidence of colonic adenomas.

The prognostic effect of CMI on clinical outcomes were evaluated among all NSC patients and compared across various craniosynostosis subtypes using Wilcoxon nonparametric tests and Kendall''s Ï to determine significance.Using preoperative CT images, we evaluated 117 children with NSC from the University of Michigan Health System. Results demonstrate that increased temporal fat pad volume and local temporalis muscle volume are associated with better clinical outcomes in craniosynostosis patients. More specifically, temporal fat pad volume was shown to be a significant predictor of perioperative blood transfusion requirements (P = 0.0033) and increased temporal muscle volume correlated with decreased hospital stay (P = 0.016) when controlling for other covariates including age, sex, weight, and preoperative hematocrit. In addition, the same significant predictors were found when examining individual subtypes of craniosynostosis.Our findings demonstrate that maxillofacial CT scans provide a useful quantitative index reflecting general patient health, risk stratification, and probabilities of intervention in addition to their previously established ability to determine the specific pathology of the patient.

To address this problem, we extended the likelihood-based method of Li et al., which assesses whether there is linkage disequilibrium between a disease locus and a SNP, to accommodate sibships of arbitrary size and disease-phenotype configuration. A key advantage of our method is the ability to combine data from different family structures. We consider scenarios for which genotypes are available for unrelated cases, affected sib pairs (ASPs), or only one sibling per ASP. We construct designs that use cases only and others that use unaffected siblings or unrelated unaffected individuals as controls. Different combinations of cases and controls result in seven study designs. We compare the efficiency of these designs when the number of individuals to be genotyped is fixed. Our results suggest that (1) when the disease is influenced by a single gene, the one sibling per ASP-control design is the most efficient, followed by the ASP-control design, and familial cases contribute more association information than singleton cases; (2) when the disease is influenced by multiple genes, familial cases provide more association information than singleton cases, unless the effect of the locus being tested is much smaller than at least one other untested disease locus; and (3) the case-control design can be useful for detecting genes with small effect in the presence of genes with much larger effect.

Patients enrolled in a blinded, interventional trial were excluded from survival analysis. Primary endpoints were successful surgical drainage (total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dL within the first 3 months), transplant-free survival (Kaplan-Meier), and time to transplant/death (Cox regression).KPE was performed in 244 infants (54% female; mean age: 65 Â± 29 days). Transplant-free survival was 53.7% and 46.7% at 1 and 2 years post-KPE. The risk of transplant/death was significantly lower in the 45.6% of patients who achieved successful bile drainage within 3 months post-KPE (HR: 0.08, P < 0.001).

We designed a study to assess the comparability of data from four laboratories that will conduct a larger microarray profiling confirmation project in lung adenocarcinomas. To test the feasibility of combining data across laboratories, frozen tumor tissues, cell line pellets, and purified RNA samples were analyzed at each of the four laboratories. Samples of each type and several subsamples from each tumor and each cell line were blinded before being distributed. The laboratories followed a common protocol for all steps of tissue processing, RNA extraction, and microarray analysis using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A arrays. High within-laboratory and between-laboratory correlations were observed on the purified RNA samples, the cell lines, and the frozen tumor tissues. Intraclass correlation within laboratories was only slightly stronger than between laboratories, and the intraclass correlation tended to be weakest for genes expressed at low levels and showing small variation. Finally, hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the repeated samples clustered together regardless of the laboratory in which the experiments were done.

Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data were analyzed for adult LT candidates listed between September 2001 and December 2006 (n = 38,899). The effect of serum creatinine on survival benefit (contrast between waitlist and post-LT mortality rates) was assessed by sequential stratification, an extension of Cox regression. At the same MELD score, serum creatinine was inversely associated with survival benefit within certain defined MELD categories. The survival benefit significantly decreased as creatinine increased for candidates with MELD scores of 15 to 17 or 24 to 40 at LT (MELD scores of 15-17, P < 0.0001; MELD scores of 24-40, P = 0.04). Renal replacement therapy at LT was also associated with significantly decreased LT benefit for patients with MELD scores of 21 to 23 (P = 0.04) or 24 to 26 (P = 0.01). In conclusion, serum creatinine at LT significantly affects survival benefit for patients with MELD scores of 15 to 17 or 24 to 40. Given the same MELD score, patients with higher creatinine levels receive less benefit on average, and the relative ranking of a large number of wait-listed candidates with MELD scores of 15 to 17 or 24 to 40 would be markedly affected if these findings were incorporated into the allocation policy.');

Associations between income inequality and mortality declined with age at death, and then reversed among those aged 65 years and older. Income inequality was inconsistently associated with specific causes of death and was not associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), breast or prostate cancer, cirrhosis, or diabetes mortality.

Statistical significance of the associations (ie, difference in slope of the regression line from zero) were based on a standard 2-sided Wald test for the regression slope parameter.From 1980 through 1999, 1,061 neonates were treated with ECMO in Michigan, and 875 (82.5%) survived. When annual neonatal mortality rate (from all causes) and the rate from respiratory causes versus ECMO volume (cases per year) are superimposed with fitted regression lines, both are significantly different from zero (P =.041 and P =.002, respectively).

The association between scales and stroke outcomes was studied using multiple linear regression with log-transformed National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Cox proportional hazards regression for recurrence and mortality.Six hundred sixty-nine patients participated; 48.7% were women. In fully adjusted models, an increase in fatalism from the first to third quartile was associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.06-1.88) and marginally associated with risk of recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.97-1.88), but not stroke severity.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(274,8947535,'The standard mechanistic model for the probability of tumour cure (the "Poisson model'') is based on the assumption that the number of surviving clonogens at the end of treatment follows a Poisson distribution from tumour to tumour. This assumption is not correct, however, if proliferation of tumour clonogens occurs during treatment, as would be expected in general during a fractionated course of radiotherapy. In the present study, the possible magnitude of the error in the Poisson model was investigated for tumours treated with either conventional fractionation or split-course therapy. An example is presented in which the Poisson model has an absolute error of nearly 100%, predicting a cure rate of 0% when in fact the cure rate was close to 100%. The largest errors in the Poisson model found in this study were for very small tumours (approximately 100 clonogens), but for larger tumours (> or = 10(6) clonogens), the Poisson model may still be highly inaccurate, predicting a cure rate that differs from the actual cure rate by as much as 40%. Three new tumour-cure models are proposed (the GS, PS, and GS+ models), and their accuracy is also investigated. Two of these (the GS and PS models) are better than the Poisson model for the clinically relevant cases tested here. The third model, the GS+ model, consistently produced the most accurate estimate of the tumour cure rate, but has more limited use than the GS and PS models because it is more highly parametrized. It is demonstrated here that no tumour-cure model based on the effective clonogen doubling time will be perfectly accurate in all cases, since the cure rate depends on the details of the cell kinetics contributing to the effective doubling time.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(275,12926229,'The use of anatomical imaging in clinical oncology practice traditionally relies on comparison of patient scans acquired before and following completion of therapeutic intervention. Therapeutic success is typically determined from inspection of gross anatomical images to assess changes in tumor size.

This would provide an early indicator or treatment response/outcome in an individual patient before completion of therapy. Moreover, response of a tumor to therapeutic intervention may be heterogeneous. The use of imaging could assist in delineating therapeutic-induced spatial heterogeneity within a tumor mass by providing information related to specific regions that are resistant or responsive to treatment.

Alterations in water mobility reflect changes in tissue structure at the cellular level.

The effect of salvage androgen deprivation therapy (SADT) on the risk of recurrence of prostate cancer is inadequately described by the existing literature. Furthermore, standard Cox regression yields biased estimates of the effect of SADT, since it is necessary to adjust for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is a time-dependent confounder and an intermediate variable. In this paper, we describe and compare two methods which appropriately adjust for PSA in estimating the effect of SADT. The first method is a two-stage method which jointly estimates the effect of SADT and the hazard of recurrence in the absence of treatment by SADT. In the first stage, PSA is predicted in the absence of SADT, and in the second stage, a time-dependent Cox model is used to estimate the benefit of SADT, adjusting for PSA. The second method, called sequential stratification, reorganizes the data to resemble a sequence of experiments in which treatment is conditionally randomized given the time-dependent covariates. Strata are formed, each consisting of a patient undergoing SADT and a set of appropriately matched controls, and analysis proceeds via stratified Cox regression. Both methods are applied to data from patients initially treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer and give similar SADT effect estimates.');

Data from 1,796 breast cancer cases were obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results and the National Longitudinal Mortality Study dataset. Cox Proportional Hazards models were constructed accounting for clustering within counties. Three sequential Cox models were fit for each outcome including demographic variables; demographic and clinical variables; and finally demographic, clinical, and county-level variables. Results.

Clinical data were obtained, and the association between morphomic measurements and clinical outcomes was evaluated using Pearson correlation for unadjusted analysis and multiple regression for adjusted analysis.The mean age of patients in the study was 47.1 years. Unadjusted analysis using Pearson correlation revealed that decreases in zygomatic bone thickness correlated strongly with increases in hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator days (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0003, and P = 0.0017, respectively).

The standard strategy for analyzing such two-stage data is to view stage 2 as a replication study and focus on findings that reach statistical significance when stage 2 data are considered alone. We demonstrate that the alternative strategy of jointly analyzing the data from both stages almost always results in increased power to detect genetic association, despite the need to use more stringent significance levels, even when effect sizes differ between the two stages.

Patients had a mean age of 7.2 years, 65% were boys, 13% had Medicaid insurance, 12% were African American, and 31% had persistent asthma. Eighty percent (717/896) of parents could identify at least 1 asthma trigger (mean, 2.2; range, 0-9). Eighty-two percent (582/717) of these parents had attempted an environmental control measure. Of 1788 actions initiated, 916 (51%) were unlikely to be beneficial on the basis of current guidelines. No specific demographic characteristic predicted which parents were more or less likely to institute environmental controls.In our sample, more than half (51%) of the environmental actions initiated were not specifically endorsed by current guidelines. Improving awareness about recognized methods to address triggers may help families use more effective measures. Clinicians should not assume that they can predict which families will be more or less likely to attempt environmental control, but should provide education regarding effective environmental measures for all families with potentially modifiable asthma triggers');

Here, we describe an efficient approach for modeling linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers during multipoint analysis of human pedigrees. Using a gene-counting algorithm suitable for pedigree data, our approach enables rapid estimation of allele and haplotype frequencies within clusters of tightly linked markers. In addition, with the use of a hidden Markov model, our approach allows for multipoint pedigree analysis with large numbers of SNP markers organized into clusters of markers in LD. Simulation results show that our approach resolves previously described biases in multipoint linkage analysis with SNPs that are in LD. An updated version of the freely available Merlin software package uses the approach described here to perform many common pedigree analyses, including haplotyping and haplotype frequency estimation, parametric and nonparametric multipoint linkage analysis of discrete traits, variance-components and regression-based analysis of quantitative traits, calculation of identity-by-descent or kinship coefficients, and case selection for follow-up association studies. To illustrate the possibilities, we examine a data set that provides evidence of linkage of psoriasis to chromosome 17.');

The sparing of dermal damage from fractionation of the X-ray dose was quantified in terms of the alpha/beta ratio in the linear-quadratic (LQ) model, at a wide range of doses per fraction reaching as low as about 1 Gy. The fit and the appropriateness of the LQ model for the skin wound healing assay was examined with the use of the Fe-plot in which inverse total dose is plotted versus dose per fraction for wound strength isoeffects. The alpha/beta ratio of the skin was about 2.5 Gy (95% confidence of less than +/- 1 Gy) and was appropriate over a dose range of 1 Gy to about 8 Gy. The low alpha/beta value is typical for a late responding tissue. This assay, therefore, has the advantage of measuring and forecasting late radiation responses of the dermis within a short time after irradiation.');

One common approach for measurement error correction is Regression Calibration (RC), which substitutes the unknown values of X by predictions from the regression of X on W estimated from the calibration sample. An alternative approach is to multiply impute the missing values of X given Y and W based on an imputation model, and then use multiple imputation (MI) combining rules for inferences. Most of current work assumes that the measurement error of W has a constant variance, whereas in many situations, the variance varies as a function of X. We consider extensions of the RC and MI methods that allow for heteroscedastic measurement error, and compare them by simulation. The MI method is shown to provide better inferences in this setting.

Recently, GLC1I was mapped to 15q11-13 in families with early adult onset of OAG. We tested for linkage to GLC1I in an independent sample of 167 individuals in 25 multiplex OAG families of European descent. We carried out nonparametric linkage analysis on the complete set of 25 families and obtained a maximum LOD score of 1.00 at 9.0 cM. Using mean age at diagnosis (AAD) across the affected individuals within each family to order the families as a proxy for age at onset, we found a maximum OSA LOD score of 2.09 (p=0.021) at 26.1 cM. The mean (+/-s.d.) AAD across the 14 earlier AAD families that contributed to the OSA LOD score was 50.6 years (+/-5.38); the mean AAD for the other 1210 later AAD families that did not contribute to the OSA LOD score (the high-AAD) was 61.7 years (+/-3.50). We also ran IOSA on our families using AAD as our covariate on which to subset affected individuals. The maximum LOD score was 1.01 at 14.3 cM when ordering subjects from early to late AAD.

The prognostic significance of nuclear grading remains controversial since most studies were performed before prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening became widely available. We evaluated the significance of nuclear grade for predicting PSA recurrence in a contemporary cohort of patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate carcinoma.Nuclear grades 1 to 3 were determined in 141 consecutive radical prostatectomies in 1995. Predominant and worst nuclear grade was determined by a consensus of 3 pathologists. Statistical analysis compared nuclear grade with Gleason score using the chi-square test. The Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to calculate the ability of nuclear grade, Gleason score and other variables to predict PSA recurrence.We identified a significant association of Gleason score with worst nuclear grade (p = 0.007). All 6 cases with a Gleason score of 8 or greater had a worst nuclear grade of 3, in contrast to 36 of 60 (60%) with a score 6 or less, in which the worst nuclear grade was 3. Of the 141 patients 31 (21.9%) had PSA recurrence at a median followup of 3.7 years. The univariate Cox model revealed significant associations of PSA recurrence with Gleason score 8 or greater (hazards ratio 5.5, p = 0.005), extraprostatic extension (hazards ratio 3.4, p = 0.001), positive surgical margin (hazards ratio 2.6, p = 0.009), seminal vesicle involvement (hazards ratio 7.3, p <0.001), preoperative serum PSA (hazards ratio 1.03, p = 0.007), tumor stage (hazards ratio 3.6, p = 0.001) and maximal tumor dimension (hazards ratio 2.4, p <0.001). However, overall and worst nuclear grade did not predict PSA recurrence (p = 0.89 and 0.13, respectively). Nuclear grade did not fit any multivariate model tested, which otherwise included Gleason score, log(PSA), surgical margin status, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle status, tumor size and pathological stage. By varying sample fixation time we also showed that benign prostate tissue in the same section as prostate carcinoma had grade 2 or 3 nuclear changes, that is moderate to marked anaplasia.High nuclear grade is associated with high Gleason score. However, prostate carcinoma with a Gleason score of 6 or less shows extreme variability.

The rate of human somatic mutation in vitro was estimated by measuring the proportion of protein variants among cell clones isolated at various times during continuous exponential growth of a TK-6 cell population. Three mutants of spontaneous origin were observed, giving an estimated spontaneous rate of 6 x 10(-8) electrophoretic mutations per allele per cell generation (i.e., 1.2 x 10(-7) per locus per cell generation). Following treatment of cells with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, a total of 74 confirmed variants at 54 loci were identified among 1143 clones analyzed (approximately 601,000 allele tests). The induced variants include 65 electromorphs which exhibit altered isoelectric charge and/or apparent molecular weight and nine nullimorphs for each of which a gene product was not detected at its usual location on the gel. The induced frequency for these 65 structural gene mutants is 1.1 x 10(-4) per allele. An excess of structural gene mutations at ten known polymorphic loci and repeat mutations at these and other loci suggest nonrandomness of mutation in human somatic cells.

Here, we show that, as progressively larger numbers of individuals are sequenced, increasingly accurate genotype calls can be generated for a given sequence depth. We evaluate the implications of low-coverage sequencing for complex trait association studies. We systematically compare study designs based on genotyping of tagSNPs, sequencing of many individuals at depths ranging between 2Ã and 30Ã, and imputation of variants discovered by sequencing a subset of individuals into the remainder of the sample. We show that sequencing many individuals at low depth is an attractive strategy for studies of complex trait genetics. For example, for disease-associated variants with frequency >0.2%, sequencing 3000 individuals at 4Ã depth provides similar power to deep sequencing of >2000 individuals at 30Ã depth but requires only ~20% of the sequencing effort.

High users share certain characteristics. They are more likely than low users to be older and poorer, to have poorer health status and more medical conditions, and are more likely to have functional limitations. Both univariate and multivariable analyses show that the most important distinguishing characteristics of high users of any of the three medical services are poor health status, severe functional limitations, and the presence of multiple medical conditions--most importantly cancer, cardiac disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, respiratory diseases, and injuries and poisonings.

The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of overweight in children who are clients of community health centers in medically underserved areas of the Health Resources and Service Administration regions II and III (Mid-Atlantic and Puerto Rico), compare this prevalence to nationally representative data, and contrast prevalence data between geographic areas and racial/ethnic groups.The charts from a representative sample of 2474 children using 30 community health centers in 2001 were abstracted to collect clinically measured weight and height. Overweight was defined as a body mass index of > or =95th percentile of a reference population. To generate an unbiased estimate of overweight, multiple imputations were used for missing data. These data were compared with the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.The prevalence of overweight was elevated in this sample of children aged 2 to 5 years (21.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 19.1-24.8) and 6 to 11 years (23.8%; 95% CI: 16.9-27.7) compared with the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (10.3% and 15.8%, respectively). No significant differences in prevalence were observed between Asian American (18.2%; 95% CI: 11.2-28.3), Hispanic (24.6%; 95% CI: 21.3-28.2), non-Hispanic black (25.6%; 95% CI: 20.8-30.9), and non-Hispanic white (22.8%; 95% CI: 19.0-27.0) children. Furthermore, no differences in prevalence were observed between children using community health centers in continental urban (23.7%; 95% CI: 20.6-27.2), suburban (24.0%; 95% CI: 20.0-28.5), or rural (22.9%; 95% CI: 19.3-26.9) areas.The present study identified a population of children at particularly high risk for obesity based on the type of health care delivery system they use regardless of race/ethnicity or geographic characteristics.

The lifetime prevalence of definite OCD was significantly higher in case than control first-degree relatives (22.5% vs. 2.6%, P < 0.05). Compared to controls, case first-degree relatives also had significantly higher lifetime rates of obsessions and compulsions (both P < 0.05).

Visual semi-quantitative estimation of bronchial wall thickness (VBT) and automated quantification of emphysema percent and bronchial wall thickness were generated. Multivariate modeling compared emphysema severity and airway abnormality with clinical outcome measures. Poisson models were used to analyze exacerbation frequency. SGRQ and SF-12 physical component scores were influenced by FEV(1)% predicted, emphysema percent, and VBT. VBT scores > 2 (scale 0-48) were associated with increased exacerbation frequency (p = 0.009) in the preceding year adjusting for age, gender, emphysema percent, smoking history and FEV(1)% predicted, although this effect was attenuated by age.

This study examined the genetic association between personality and MDD and BD by applying polygenic scores for neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness to both disorders. Polygenic scores reflect the weighted sum of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles associated with the trait for an individual and were based on a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for personality traits including 13,835 subjects. Polygenic scores were tested for MDD in the combined Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN-MDD) and MDD2000+ samples (N=8921) and for BD in the combined Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder and Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium samples (N=6329) using logistic regression analyses.

We assume that the total dose and overall treatment time for each patient are altered by consideration of three possible factors, the pre treatment size of the tumor, the response of the tumor to therapy or the amount of acute effects.We find that individualizing treatment leads to very small improvements in the local control rate, but substantial biases in the estimates of the doubling time and the effective D0 value. Patient selection also compromises the validity of confidence intervals and tests. Despite this selection bias our results suggest that if there were no real effect of treatment time then the influence of individualizing treatments would not cause treatment time to be found to be as important as it has been shown to be in many studies.Assuming the fundamental radiobiological assumptions in the model are appropriate, individual alterations of the fractionation schedule due to the response to therapy can compromise the interpretation of dose-time analyses of retrospective data, without giving much improvement in the control rate.');

Thus, SES differences in health are small in early adulthood, but increase with age until relatively late in life, when they diminish due to selection or greater equalization of health risks and protections. The present paper strengthens our causal and interpretive understanding of these phenomena by showing: (1) that results previously reported for indices of SES hold separately for education and income; (2) that the interaction between age and SES (i.e., education or income) in predicting health can be substantially explained by the greater exposure of lower SES persons to a wide range of psychosocial risk factors to health, especially in middle and early old age, and, to a lesser degree, the greater impact of these risk factors on health with age; and (3) that results (1) and (2) generally hold in short-term longitudinal as well as in cross-sectional data.

One potential explanation for the excess risk in African Americans might be racial differences in maternal clinical risk factors, such as prior pregnancy history and pregnancy complications. This paper examines the contributions of such clinical indicators to racial differences in pre-term delivery in a study sample of urban, low-income women, aged 18 to 43 years.Study participants were enrolled during their first prenatal care visit at one of four hospital-based, prenatal care clinics in Baltimore City. Medical history and pregnancy outcome data were abstracted from clinical records. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the independent relationship between race and pre-term birth, after controlling for clinical factors.Without adjustment for clinical risk factors, African-American women were 1.8 times more likely than White women to have a pre-term birth outcome (95% confidence interval 1.20-2.78). After statistical adjustment for the clinical variables, however, the association between race and pre-term birth was diminished (OR = 1.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-2.72). Moreover, the associations between certain clinical risks and pre-term birth were stronger for African-American than White women.These results suggest that attention to clinical risk factors among African-American women may be an important avenue for reducing Black/White racial disparities in pre-term birth.');

All patients had failed first-line and salvage chemotherapy with a median of 6 (range 4-12) cisplatin-based treatment cycles, 13/15 (87%) patients had received high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and 8/15 (53%) patients were considered platinum-refractory or absolute refractory; 8/15 (53%) patients had previously received other palliative chemotherapy regimens. No patient achieved a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR). However, 5/15 (33%) patients achieved serological PR and 1 additional patient had stable disease for 3 months. The median duration of remissions was 3 months (range 2-12 months) including 2 patients with a progression-free survival of 9 and 12 months. Responses occurred mainly in patients with a low tumour burden, slow disease progression and alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) elevations. Responses to thalidomide were independent from platinum-sensitivity. Toxicity was mild, with lethargy and constipation in the majority of patients. Skin rash grade II developed in 2 patients and peripheral neurotoxicity grade II/III developed in 4 patients.

Cell surface CD27 can be proteolytically cleaved to produce a 32-kDa soluble CD27 (sCD27) molecule. Elevated levels of sCD27 are seen in a number of disease states and malignancies. Although it has been reported that cerebrospinal fluid sCD27 levels were elevated in people who had AIDS dementia, little is known about CD27 expression in HIV disease. To determine if sCD27 levels were elevated in those with HIV infection, and/or in those with AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin''s lymphoma (AIDS-NHL), sCD27 levels were measured in HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects as well as in people who developed AIDS-NHL. Serum sCD27 levels were seen to be elevated in HIV+ subjects. Furthermore, sCD27 levels were particularly elevated in those subjects who went on to develop AIDS-NHL, with serum sCD27 levels in AIDS-NHL subjects being significantly higher than those in HIV+ subjects who did not develop lymphoma. Most AIDS-NHL cell lines and primary AIDS-NHL tumor specimens expressed both CD27 and its ligand, CD70. The proportion of circulating B cells that expressed cell surface CD27 was substantially reduced in those with HIV infection, and B cells from HIV-infected subjects produced decreased levels of sCD27 in culture. Together, these results indicate that CD27/sCD27 expression is abnormal in HIV infection and suggest that this molecule merits further examination as a potential marker for AIDS-NHL.');

Nevertheless, the translation of these technologies into clinical tests that are useful for guiding management decisions for patients has been relatively slow. It can be difficult to determine when the body of evidence for an omics-based test is sufficiently comprehensive and reliable to support claims that it is ready for clinical use, or even that it is ready for definitive evaluation in a clinical trial in which it may be used to direct patient therapy. Reasons for this difficulty include the exploratory and retrospective nature of many of these studies, the complexity of these assays and their application to clinical specimens, and the many potential pitfalls inherent in the development of mathematical predictor models from the very high-dimensional data generated by these omics technologies. Here we present a checklist of criteria to consider when evaluating the body of evidence supporting the clinical use of a predictor to guide patient therapy. Included are issues pertaining to specimen and assay requirements, the soundness of the process for developing predictor models, expectations regarding clinical study design and conduct, and attention to regulatory, ethical, and legal issues. The proposed checklist should serve as a useful guide to investigators preparing proposals for studies involving the use of omics-based tests.

The analyses are conducted using variance components methods. We contrast the effects of error on quantitative trait analyses with those on the affected sib-pair design. The results indicate that genotyping error influences linkage studies of affected sib pairs more severely than studies of quantitative traits in unselected sibs. In situations of modest effect size, 5% genotyping error eliminates all supporting evidence for linkage to a true susceptibility locus in affected pairs, but may only result in a loss of 15% of linkage information in random pairs. Multipoint analysis does not suffer substantially more than two-point analysis; for moderate error rates (< 5%), multipoint analysis with error is more powerful than two-point with no error.

The data show that the onset of regeneration is within 14 h of the first dose and possibly earlier. The doubling time of the clonogenic cells during repopulation is estimated to be between 5 and 10 h, with the most likely value approximately 6 to 7 h. The data also show that the time course of repopulation in an acutely responding tissue depended in a complex way on the fractionation scheme. The implications of this for radiotherapy are that simple formulas are unlikely to be accurate predictors of acute effects in altered fractionation schemes. Detailed mathematical modelling of the data is undertaken using a model which consists of a single dose survival curve, a part to incorporate the regenerative response and a part to accommodate the delayed onset of regeneration. The model is shown to give a good, although not perfect, fit to the data. A mathematical derivation is given of the expected number of crypts following the 3 dose radiation schedule. This derivation takes into account the fact that any crypt could be denuded of cells prior to the final dose and hence not repopulate, and thus the formula given is necessarily more complex than previous formulas which were based on simpler models.');

To date, deconvolution analysis assumes the number and approximate location of these pulses are known a priori. In this article, we present a novel Bayesian approach to deconvolution that jointly models the number of pulses along with all other model parameters. Our method stochastically searches for the secretion pulses. This is accomplished by viewing the set of parameters that define the pulses as a point process. Pulses are determined by a birth-death process which is embedded in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. This idea originated with Stephens (2000, Annals of Statistics 28, 40-74) in the context of finite mixture model density estimation, where the number of mixture components is unknown.

Forty-two percent had committed an offense classified as ''serious,'' and 21% had an ''at-fault'' crash.

Examining the empirical rates directly, it was found that the rate for minor offenses increased somewhat with time and then stabilized, while the rate for serious offenses declined. Also, offenses were less likely to be serious the later they occurred in the sequence of offenses for an individual. For crashes, the risk of having an at-fault crash declined more rapidly than the risk of a not-at-fault crash, although the rate of decrease began to equalize after approximately 5 years of licensure.

To gain insights into these potential mechanisms, we analyzed clinically indicated lung resections from three human cohorts, correlating findings with spirometrically defined disease severity. Expression by lung CD8(+) T cells of IL-18R and CD69 correlated with severity, as did mRNA transcripts for perforin and granzyme B, but not Fas ligand. These correlations persisted after correction for age, smoking history, presence of lung cancer, recent respiratory infection, or inhaled corticosteroid use. Analysis of transcripts for killer cell lectin-like receptor G1, IL-7R, and CD57 implied that lung CD8(+) T cells in COPD do not belong to the terminally differentiated effector populations associated with chronic infections or extreme age. In vitro stimulation of lung CD8(+) T cells with IL-18 plus IL-12 markedly increased production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, whereas IL-15 stimulation induced increased intracellular perforin expression. Both IL-15 and IL-18 protein expression could be measured in whole lung tissue homogenates, but neither correlated in concentration with spirometric severity. Although lung CD8(+) T cell expression of mRNA for both T-box transcription factor expressed in T cells and GATA-binding protein 3 (but not retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma or alpha) increased with spirometric severity, stimulation of lung CD8(+) T cells via CD3epsilon-induced secretion of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and GM-CSF, but not IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17A.

Since fully resequencing a cohort is prohibitively costly, genetic association studies take advantage of local correlation structure (or linkage disequilibrium) between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by selecting a subset of SNPs to be genotyped (tag SNPs). While many current association studies are performed using commercially available high-throughput genotyping products that define a set of tag SNPs, choosing tag SNPs remains an important problem for both custom follow-up studies as well as designing the high-throughput genotyping products themselves. The most widely used tag SNP selection method optimizes the correlation between SNPs (r(2)). However, tag SNPs chosen based on an r(2) criterion do not necessarily maximize the statistical power of an association study. We propose a study design framework that chooses SNPs to maximize power and efficiently measures the power through empirical simulation. Empirical results based on the HapMap data show that our method gains considerable power over a widely used r(2)-based method, or equivalently reduces the number of tag SNPs required to attain the desired power of a study. Our power-optimized 100k whole genome tag set provides equivalent power to the Affymetrix 500k chip for the CEU population.

All treatments involved CT planning to ensure coverage of the intended targets. Treatment consisted of prostate-only treatment, prostate and seminal vesicle treatment, or PRT of lymph nodes at risk followed by a boost. To create relatively homogenous analysis groups, each patient''s percentage of risk of lymph node (%rLN) involvement was assigned by matching the patient''s T stage, Gleason score, and initial prostate-specific antigen level to the appropriate value as described in the updated Partin tables. Three categories of %rLN involvement were defined: low, 0-5%; intermediate, >5-15%; and high, >15%. Biochemical recurrence was defined as the first occurrence of either the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology consensus definition of prostate-specific antigen failure or the initiation of salvage hormonal therapy for any reason.The risk status (%rLN) could be determined for 709 low-risk, 263 intermediate-risk, and 309 high-risk patients. The actuarial freedom from biochemical recurrence (bNED) and the log-rank test for the similarity of the control and treatment survival functions are reported for each risk group.

Controlling for age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, income, fruit and vegetable consumption, current smoking and alcohol use, we found that: (1) foreign-born adults had lower BMI than US-born adults; (2) among foreign-born adults, longer residence in the United States was associated with higher BMI; and (3) the effect of birthplace-length of US residence on BMI differed by education level, gender and race/ethnicity. Specifically, longer residence in the United States was associated with the greatest percent increases in BMI among the lowest educated groups than higher educated groups, among women (vs. men) and among Hispanics (vs. other racial/ethnic groups). These findings suggest that a protective effect of foreign birthplace on BMI appears to attenuate with length of residence in the United States, and also reveal that BMI/obesity trajectories associated with length of US residence vary by education, gender and race/ethnicity. Immigrant status, independently and in combination with education, gender and race/ethnicity should be considered in future obesity prevention and reduction efforts.');

Logistic and Cox regression models were adjusted for patient characteristics and time on hemodialysis.During training, US surgeons created fewer fistulae (US mean = 16 vs. 39-426 in other countries) and noted less emphasis on vascular access placement compared with surgeons elsewhere. Significant predictors of fistula versus graft placement in hemodialysis patients included number of fistulae placed during training (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.2 for fistula placement, per 2 times greater number of fistulae placed during training, P < 0.0001) and degree of emphasis on vascular access creation during training (AOR = 2.4 for fistula placement, for much-to-extreme emphasis vs. no emphasis, P = 0.0008). Risk of primary fistula failure was 34% lower (relative risk = 0.66, P = 0.002) when placed by surgeons who created > or = 25 (vs. < 25) fistulae during training.Surgical training is key to both fistula placement and survival, yet US surgical programs seem to place less emphasis on fistula creation than those in other countries.

However, the key assumption of conditional independence between the marker and the event given the latent classes is difficult to evaluate because the latent classes are not observed. Using a joint model with latent classes and shared random effects, we propose a score test for the null hypothesis of independence between the marker and the outcome given the latent classes versus the alternative hypothesis that the risk of event depends on one or several random effects from the mixed model in addition to the latent classes. A simulation study was performed to compare the behavior of the score test to other previously proposed tests, including situations where the alternative hypothesis or the baseline risk function are misspecified.

This observational cohort study included all 2575 patients who were registered on the Dutch waiting list for a first kidney transplant between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2004. From listing until the earliest of death, living-donor kidney transplantation, or December 31, 2005, 459 patients received a DCD transplant and 680 patients received a DBD transplant. Graft failure during the first 3 months after transplantation was twice as likely for DCD kidneys than DBD kidneys (12 versus 6.3%; P=0.001). Standard-criteria DCD transplantation associated with a 56% reduced risk for mortality (hazard ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.80) compared with continuing on dialysis and awaiting a standard-criteria DBD kidney. This reduction in mortality translates into 2.4-month additional expected lifetime during the first 4 years after transplantation for recipients of DCD kidneys compared with patients who await a DBD kidney.

We implement multiple imputation based on a model-robust estimate of the covariance matrix of parameters of the imputing model to provide confidence intervals for the geometric mean of the time since seroconversion in the prevalent subcohort, and to compare maturity of infection of cohorts recruited in different cities.

Fifty-four patients developed a C difficile infection, for a hospital median rate of 2.8% (range, 0-14.7%). Use of mechanical bowel preparation was not associated with an increased incidence of C difficile infection (P = .95).

The proportion of patients in whom C difficile infection was diagnosed after the use of preoperative oral antibiotics was smaller than the proportion of patients with C difficile infection who did not receive oral antibiotics (1.6% vs 2.9%, P = .09).The potential exists for underestimation of C difficile infection because of the study''s strict data collection criteria and risk of undetected infection after postoperative day 30.In contrast to previous single-center data, this multicenter study showed that the preoperative use of mechanical bowel preparation was not associated with increased risk of C difficile infection after colectomy.

It is incorrect, in the sense of yielding biased estimates of population quantities, if the design variables are related to survey non-response; it is unnecessary if the design variables are unrelated to survey non-response. The correct approach is to model non-response as a function of the adjustment cell and design variables, and to estimate the response weight as the inverse of the estimated response probability from this model.

Times to failure for AVF and graft were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression.AVF was used by 80% of EUR and 24% of US prevalent patients, and was significantly associated with younger age, male gender, lower body mass index, non-diabetic status, lack of peripheral vascular disease, and no angina. After adjusting for these factors, AVF versus graft use was still much higher in EUR than US (AOR=21, P < 0.0001). AVF use within facilities varied from 0 to 87% (median 21%) in the US, and 39 to 100% (median 83%) in EUR. For patients who were new to HD, access use was: 66% AVF in EUR versus 15% in US (AOR=39, P < 0.0001), 31% catheters in EUR vs. 60% in US, and 2% grafts in EUR vs. 24% in US. In addition, 25% of EUR and 46% of US incident patients did not have a permanent access placed prior to starting HD. In EUR, 84% of new HD patients had seen a nephrologist for> 30 days prior to ESRD compared with 74% in the US (P < 0.0001); pre-ESRD care was associated with increased odds of AVF versus graft use (AOR=1.9, P=0.01). New HD patients had a 1.8-fold greater odds (P=0.002) of starting HD with a permanent access if a facility''s typical time from referral to access placement was < or =2 weeks.

All aspects of the analytical process are discussed, including cohort selection, post-transplant follow-up analysis, outcome definition, ascertainment of events, censoring, and adjustments. The methods employed for descriptive analyses are described, such as unadjusted mortality rates and survival probabilities, and the estimation of covariant effects through regression modeling. A section on transplant waiting time focuses on the kidney and liver waiting lists, pointing out the different considerations each list requires and the larger questions that such analyses raise. Additionally, this article describes specialized modeling strategies recently designed by the SRTR and aimed at specific organ allocation issues. The article concludes with a description of simulated allocation modeling (SAM), which has been developed by the SRTR for three organ systems: liver, thoracic organs, and kidney-pancreas. SAMs are particularly useful for comparing outcomes for proposed national allocation policies. The use of SAMs has already helped in the development and implementation of a new policy for liver candidates with high MELD scores to be offered organs regionally before the organs are offered to candidates with low MELD scores locally.');

The objectives of this study were to compare images obtained with two different exposures in computed radiography with conventional and asymmetric screen-film images of the chest for the detection of simulated lung nodules by use of receiver operating characteristic analysis and to relate differences in observer performance to parameters of image noise measured for each receptor condition.At 110 kVp (fixed), exposures for the two screen-film systems were those necessary to achieve adequate optical densities over the lung and mediastinal regions of an anthropomorphic phantom. The two exposures used for the computed radiographs corresponded to the exposure used for the conventional chest screen-film system and an exposure 22% lower. An anthropomorphic phantom constructed of materials matched to the muscle, lung, and bone attenuation of a muscular adult man was used. Soft-tissue-equivalent plastic nodules of various sizes were secured at multiple sites on the phantom to simulate lung nodules. The chest phantom was imaged in 50 configurations with a total of 70 superimposed nodules. The perceptual performances of five radiologists were compared by use of receiver operating characteristic analysis. The signal-to-noise ratio in the mediastinum and the coefficient of variation of noise were measured for all four image conditions by use of a step wedge technique to provide an explanation for differences in diagnostic accuracy.We found no significant differences in the detection of lung nodules between the two screen-film systems or between the conventional screen-film images and the standard-exposure computed radiographs. However, there was a significant decrease in nodule detection on computed radiographs obtained at a reduced exposure; this result was associated with a 21% decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio.Our results show that underexposure of computed radiographs decreases the detection of low-contrast objects such as lung nodules. Although consistent global optical density on computed radiographs is achieved over a wide range of exposures, the alterations in signal-to-noise ratio that result from underexposure can reduce the diagnostic quality of computed radiographs.');

MEHMs combine features of selection models and pattern-mixture models: they directly model the missingness process as in selection models, and enjoy the computational simplicity of pattern-mixture models. The MEHM provides a generalization of shared-parameter models (SPMs) by relaxing the conditional independence assumption between the measurement process and the dropout process given random effects. Because SPMs are nested within MEHMs, likelihood ratio tests can be constructed to evaluate the conditional independence assumption of SPMs. We use data from a pediatric AIDS clinical trial to illustrate the models.');

For the case-control comparison, we collected DNA from 223 subjects with clinically diagnosed DN and 196 control subjects with normoalbuminuria and long-duration type 1 diabetes (> or = 15 years). For the family-based study, we obtained DNA from both parents of 154 DN subjects and 81 control subjects. The frequency of the epsilon2 allele of exon 4 of APOE was significantly higher in DN subjects than in control subjects. The risk of DN was 3.1 times higher (95% CI 1.6-5.9) in carriers of this allele than in noncarriers. In the family study, heterozygous parents for the E2 allele preferentially transmitted epsilon2 to DN offspring (64 vs. 36%, P < 0.03). Four additional polymorphisms (i.e., -491 A/T, -219 G/T, IE1 G/C, and APOCI insertion/deletion [I/D]) that flank the APOE locus were not associated with DN in either the case-control comparison or in the family-based study. In conclusion, the results of the case-control as well as the family-based study provide evidence that the epsilon2 allele of APOE increases the risk of DN in type 1 diabetes.

Households were randomized into a control group, a group receiving a free-standing HEPA filter placed in the child''s sleeping area, and a group receiving the filter and a window-mounted AC. Indoor air quality (IAQ) was monitored for week-long periods over three to four seasons. High concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide were frequently seen. When IAQ was monitored, filters reduced PM levels in the child''s bedroom by an average of 50%. Filter use varied greatly among households and declined over time, for example, during weeks when pollutants were monitored, filter use was initially high, averaging 84Â±27%, but dropped to 63Â±33% in subsequent seasons. In months when households were not visited, use averaged only 34Â±30%. Filter effectiveness did not vary in homes with central or room ACs. The study shows that measurements over multiple seasons are needed to characterize air quality and filter performance. The effectiveness of interventions using free-standing air filters depends on occupant behavior, and strategies to ensure filter use should be an integral part of interventions.Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) increased particulate matter (PM) levels by about 14 Î¼g/m3 and was often detected using ETS-specific tracers despite restrictions on smoking in the house as reported on questionnaires administered to caregivers. PM concentrations depended on season, filter usage, relative humidity, air exchange ratios, number of children, outdoor PM levels, sweeping/dusting, and presence of a central air conditioner (AC). Free-standing air filters can be an effective intervention that provides substantial reductions in PM concentrations if the filters are used. However, filter use was variable across the study population and declined over the study duration, and thus strategies are needed to encourage and maintain use of filters. The variability in filter use suggests that exposure misclassification is a potential problem in intervention studies using filters. The installation of a room AC in the bedroom, intended to limit air exchange ratios, along with an air filter, did not lower PM levels more than the filter alone.');

The neighborhood physical environment score combined measures of a better walking environment and greater availability of healthy foods. The neighborhood social environment score combined measures of greater aesthetic quality, safety, and social cohesion and less violent crime. Marginal maximum likelihood was used to estimate associations between neighborhood environments and body mass index (kg/m(2)) before and after adjustment for individual-level covariates.

A hamster cell line carrying an intact human chromosome 8 was fused with another hamster cell line. Two sets of hybrid cell panels from 2 separate fusions were generated; each panel consisted of 50 independent clones; 33 and 34 cell lines from the 2 fusions retained human chromsome material as determined by inter-Alu PCR. The combined panel was genotyped for 52 markers spanning the entire chromosome, including 10 genes, 29 anonymous polymorphic loci, and 13 STSs. Seventeen of these markers have not been previously described. Markers near the centromere were retained at a higher frequency than more distal markers. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was also used to localize and order a subset of the markers. A RH map of the WRN region was constructed using a maximum likelihood method, giving the following most likely order: D8S131-D8S339 (GSR)-D8S124-D8S278-D8S259-(D8S71)-D8S283- D8S87-D8S105-D8S135 (FGFR1)-D8S135PB-D8S255-ANK1.

At initial diagnosis, difficulty with bright lights and with light and dark adaptation were the most frequently reported symptoms related to visual function, whereas visual distortion was the most bothersome. Approximately half of the patients reported at least some worry or concern about the possibility of blindness. Within the Visual Activities Questionnaire, higher scores on the Peripheral Vision subscale were associated with more field loss (P < 0.01).

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(409,21955029,'Many existing cohort studies initially designed to investigate disease risk as a function of environmental exposures have collected genomic data in recent years with the objective of testing for gene-environment interaction (G Ã E) effects. In environmental epidemiology, interest in G Ã E arises primarily after a significant effect of the environmental exposure has been documented. Cohort studies often collect rich exposure data; as a result, assessing G Ã E effects in the presence of multiple exposure markers further increases the burden of multiple testing, an issue already present in both genetic and environment health studies. Latent variable (LV) models have been used in environmental epidemiology to reduce dimensionality of the exposure data, gain power by reducing multiplicity issues via condensing exposure data, and avoid collinearity problems due to presence of multiple correlated exposures. We extend the LV framework to characterize gene-environment interaction in presence of multiple correlated exposures and genotype categories. Further, similar to what has been done in case-control G Ã E studies, we use the assumption of gene-environment (G-E) independence to boost the power of tests for interaction. The consequences of making this assumption, or the issue of how to explicitly model G-E association has not been previously investigated in LV models. We postulate a hierarchy of assumptions about the LV model regarding the different forms of G-E dependence and show that making such assumptions may influence inferential results on the G, E, and G Ã E parameters. We implement a class of shrinkage estimators to data adaptively trade-off between the most restrictive to most flexible form of G-E dependence assumption and note that such class of compromise estimators can serve as a benchmark of model adequacy in LV models. We demonstrate the methods with an example from the Early Life Exposures in Mexico City to Neuro-Toxicants Study of lead exposure, iron metabolism genes, and birth weight.');

This new technology, ChIP-Seq, presents opportunities for in-depth analysis of transcription regulation. In this study, we explore the value of using ChIP-Seq data to better detect and refine transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). We introduce a novel computational algorithm named Hybrid Motif Sampler (HMS), specifically designed for TFBS motif discovery in ChIP-Seq data. We propose a Bayesian model that incorporates sequencing depth information to aid motif identification. Our model also allows intra-motif dependency to describe more accurately the underlying motif pattern. Our algorithm combines stochastic sampling and deterministic ''greedy'' search steps into a novel hybrid iterative scheme. This combination accelerates the computation process. Simulation studies demonstrate favorable performance of HMS compared to other existing methods. When applying HMS to real ChIP-Seq datasets, we find that (i) the accuracy of existing TFBS motif patterns can be significantly improved; and (ii) there is significant intra-motif dependency inside all the TFBS motifs we tested; modeling these dependencies further improves the accuracy of these TFBS motif patterns. These findings may offer new biological insights into the mechanisms of transcription factor regulation.');

Given the individual classes in the model, the data are typically modeled as Gaussian random variates or as random variates from some other parametric distribution. In this article, we present a non-parametric Potts model and apply it to a functional magnetic resonance imaging study for the pre-surgical assessment of peritumoral brain activation. In our model, we assume that the Z-score image from a patient can be segmented into activated, deactivated, and null classes, or states. Conditional on the class, or state, the Z-scores are assumed to come from some generic distribution which we model non-parametrically using a mixture of Dirichlet process priors within the Bayesian framework. The posterior distribution of the model parameters is estimated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and Bayesian decision theory is used to make the final classifications. Our Potts prior model includes two parameters, the standard spatial regularization parameter and a parameter that can be interpreted as the a priori probability that each voxel belongs to the null, or background state, conditional on the lack of spatial regularization. We assume that both of these parameters are unknown, and jointly estimate them along with other model parameters. We show through simulation studies that our model performs on par, in terms of posterior expected loss, with parametric Potts models when the parametric model is correctly specified and outperforms parametric models when the parametric model in misspecified.');

They are attractive because a trial using a surrogate endpoint is typically smaller, faster, and cheaper than a trial using a clinical endpoint. In seminal work, Prentice gave a framework for studying surrogate endpoints and a formal definition of conditions that a marker should satisfy to be a valid surrogate endpoint. These definitions involve consideration of the joint distribution of the marker and the clinical endpoint. It is well recognized that the formal definition is unlikely to be satisfied in practice, and thus quantifying the proportion of treatment explained (PTE) by a surrogate marker is an intuitively appealing concept. Freedman et al. suggested a statistic to quantify the PTE. In the situation of a censored clinical event time and a longitudinal marker, calculation of this statistic requires fitting two different survival models. We show that for these two models to be consistent with one another requires a specific assumption about the joint model for the longitudinally measured marker and the clinical endpoint. Furthermore, in a simulation study we show that the Freedman et al. PTE statistic and other measures of surrogacy, motivated by the Prentice framework, can be estimated using the joint model.

DESIGN/MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study was designed to relate acceleration/deceleration patterns in FSH rate of change to time to final menstrual period (FMP) and chronological age using nonparametric and piecewise regression modeling.Four major FSH stages, based on rate of FSH change patterns, were identifiable in relation to the FMP. In FSH stage 1, the rate of FSH change increased modestly up to -7 yr prior to the FMP; in FSH stage 2 (-7 to -2 yr prior to FMP), there was a major acceleration in FSH rate of change. FSH stage 3 had an acute increase in FSH rate of change (-2 to +1 yr around the FMP), with average FSH level of 34 mIU/ml. The fourth, or plateau, FSH stage began at 1 yr after FMP when the average FSH level was 54 mIU/ml. During the yr 28-60, there were eight age-specific epochs defined by significant changes of FSH trajectory accelerations or decelerations and rate of change.Four menopause transition stages bounding the FMP and eight epochs in chronological aging from age 28 to 60 yr were defined by changes of FSH trajectory accelerations/decelerations and rates of change. This timing information, combined with knowledge of FSH levels and menstrual cycle characteristics, can help discern the likely status of women with respect to their reproductive viability and menopause transition stage.');

Only severe (Grades 3-4) late complications were analyzed.With more than 5 years follow-up, it was found that total dose was a factor for all three types of complications, but that in other respects, the radiobiology of late-(> 3 months) developing mucosal ulcerations was different from that for mandibular necrosis and muscle injury. Dose per fraction was a significant factor for bone and muscle (estimated alpha/beta values of 0.85 Gy and 3.1 Gy, respectively). By contrast, mucosa showed no influence on response from change in fraction size over the range of approximately 1.0-3.5 Gy. Complications in bone and muscle were not related to overall treatment duration, whereas there was a significant inverse relationship for mucosa breakdown. The rate of development of complications was fastest in mucosa and slowest in bone. The appearance of complications by 4 years after treatment was about 80% of those developing by 8 years in the mucosa, 66% in muscle, and about 50% in bone. The high alpha/beta ratio, inverse relationship with overall treatment duration, and faster development of mucosal complications suggests that they may develop as a consequence of earlier mucosal injury. As anticipated, adequate retrospective analysis of acute complications could not be made even when objective criteria such as weight loss, unplanned delays in completing treatment, or hospitalization during treatment were the measures. Field size was a significant factor for mandible complications, but not for muscle or mucosa.The radiobiological characteristics of bone and muscle were those characteristic of other late-responding tissues, whereas late sequelae in mucosa had radiobiological parameters similar to those for acute responses.

Study subjects included 752 persons who progressed to AIDS before December 31, 1999, and were patients at either of two major HIV care facilities in Detroit, MIchigan. Separate statistical models were used to test associations between survival time after meeting the criteria for AIDS and two indicators of access to health care: (1) perceived access to health care and (2) health care utilization patterns. Perceived access was not associated with survival time after AIDS, but patterns of health care utilization were significantly associated with survival time after AIDS (HR = 2.04, p < 0.001). Individuals who received a greater proportion of their care in the ER had a worse survival prognosis than those who received more of their health care in an outpatient clinic setting.

Increasing age slightly reduced specificity. Mean WASO/night was 49.1 min by PSG compared to 36.8 min/night by actigraphy (Î² = 0.81; CI = 0.42, 1.21), unbiased when WASO < 30 min/night, and overestimated when WASO > 30 min/night.This validation quantifies strengths and weaknesses of actigraphy as a tool measuring sleep in clinical and population studies. Overall, the participant-specific accuracy is relatively high, and for most participants, above 80%. We validate this finding across multiple nights and a variety of adults across much of the young to midlife years, in both men and women, in those with and without insomnia, and in 77 participants.

Results Of the 17,926 patients analyzed, 8037 (44.8%) underwent early cardiac catheterization less than 48 hours following presentation. Predictors of early invasive management included cardiology care, younger age, lack of prior or current congestive heart failure, lack of renal insufficiency, ischemic electrocardiographic changes, positive cardiac markers, white race, and male sex. Patients treated with early invasive management were more likely to be treated with medications and interventions recommended by the ACC/AHA guidelines and had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality after adjusting for differences in clinical characteristics and after comparing propensity-matched pairs (2.5% vs 3.7%, P<.001).

This shift in treatment strategy can have substantial financial impact on Medicare and the health care system in general. The specific aims of this project were to quantify the current and future Medicare expenditures attributable to DRF and to compare Medicare payments for the 4 treatment options for elderly DRF.We analyzed the 100% 2007 Medicare dataset for annual DRF-attributable spending. Payments were obtained for claims that were identified as attributable to DRF by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes for DRF in conjunction with a Current Procedural Technology code for relevant treatment or service. We projected annual payments based on increasing internal fixation treatment. All payments are reported in 2007 U.S. dollars.In 2007, Medicare made $170 million in DRF-attributable payments. If the usage of internal fixation were to reach 50%, DRF-attributable payments could be nearly $240 million. The mean attributable payment made for each patient in 2007 was $1,983. Most of this is due to facility and staffing cost for the treatment procedure.This analysis provides an accurate quantification of Medicare DRF-attributable expenditure. Use of 100% Medicare data allows for the summation of actual patient experience rather than modeling or estimation. The burden of DRF is going to grow as the U.S. population ages and as internal fixation becomes more widely used.

Adjustment for gene locus length is necessary because it is often positively associated with the presence of one or more peaks and because many biologically defined gene sets have an excess of genes with longer or shorter gene locus lengths. Unlike alternative methods, ChIP-Enrich can account for the wide range of gene locus length-to-peak presence relationships (observed in ENCODE ChIP-seq data sets).

We investigated the incremental impact of ICH CT findings on mortality prediction model performance.Cases of ICH and IS (2000-2003) were identified from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. Base models predicting 30-day mortality included demographics, stroke type, and clinical findings (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) +/- Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)). The impact of adding CT data (volume, intraventricular hemorrhage, infratentorial location) was assessed with the area under the curve (AUC), unweighted sum of squared residuals (Å), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). The model assessment was performed first for the mixed case of IS and ICH, and then repeated for ICH cases alone to determine whether any lack of improvement in model performance with CT data for mixed stroke type was due to IS cases naturally forming a larger proportion of the total sample than ICH.A total of 1,256 cases were included (86% IS, 14% ICH). Thirty-day mortality was 16% overall (11% for IS; 43% for ICH). When both clinical scales (NIHSS and GCS) were included, none of the model performance measures showed improvement with the addition of CT findings whether considering IS and ICH together (ÎAUC: 0.002, 95% CI -0.01, 0.02; ÎÅ: -3.0, 95% CI -9.1, 2.6; IDI: 0.017, 95% CI -0.004, 0.05) or considering ICH cases alone (ÎAUC: 0.02, 95% CI -0.02, 0.08; ÎÅ: -2.0, 95% CI -9.7, 3.4; IDI 0.065, 95% CI -0.03, 0.21).

We first statistically estimate the haplotypes for each individual within the GWAS sample (pre-phasing) and then impute missing genotypes into these estimated haplotypes. This reduces the computational cost because (i) the GWAS samples must be phased only once, whereas standard methods would implicitly repeat phasing with each reference panel update, and (ii) it is much faster to match a phased GWAS haplotype to one reference haplotype than to match two unphased GWAS genotypes to a pair of reference haplotypes.

Diversity of species varied across different hormonal milieu, and on the day of embryo transfer correlated with outcome (live birth/no live birth). The species diversity index distinguished women who had a live birth from those who did not.This metagenomics approach has enabled discovery of novel, previously unidentified bacterial species in the human vagina in different hormonal milieu and supports a shift in the vaginal microbiome during IVF-ET therapy using standard protocols.

From information in a clinical vignette, respondents were asked to identify the reasons they would need to refer a high-risk patient to a more specialized facility for care. We performed multivariable analysis controlling for hospital and physician characteristics.Thirty-two percent of respondents reported never referring thyroid cancer patients to another facility. Of those that would refer a high-risk patient to another facility, the opportunity for a patient to enter a clinical trial was the most common reason reported (44%), followed by high-dose radioactive iodine (RAI) with or without dosimetry (33%), lateral neck dissection (24%), and external beam radiation (15%). In multivariable analysis, endocrinologists with a higher percentage of their practice devoted to thyroid cancer care were significantly less likely to refer patients to another facility (P = .003).The majority of endocrinologists treating thyroid cancer patients report referring a high-risk patient to another facility for some or all of their care.

In the U.S. sample, we identified two novel non-conservative RTN4R coding variants in two patients with schizophrenia that were absent in 600 control chromosomes. In our complementary mouse model studies, we identified a haploinsufficient effect of Rtn4r on locomotor activity, but normal performance in schizophrenia-related behavioral tasks. We also provide evidence that Rtn4r deficiency can modulate the long-term behavioral effects of transient postnatal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction.Our results do not support a major role of RTN4R in susceptibility to schizophrenia or the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed in individuals with 22q11 microdeletions.

Another simple practical approach that has not received much theoretical attention is to drop the regressor variables containing missing values from the regression modeling (DV, for drop variables). DV does not lead to bias when either (i) the regression coefficient of W is zero or (ii) W and Z are uncorrelated. We propose a pseudo-Bayesian approach for regression with missing covariates that compromises between the CC and DV estimates, exploiting information in the incomplete cases when the data support DV assumptions.

The disease is the result not only of several environmental risk factors, but also of genetic predisposition. To take advantage of recent advances in gene-mapping technology, we executed a genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with obesity-related quantitative traits in the genetically isolated population of Sardinia. Initial analysis suggested that several SNPs in the FTO and PFKP genes were associated with increased BMI, hip circumference, and weight. Within the FTO gene, rs9930506 showed the strongest association with BMI (p = 8.6 x10(-7)), hip circumference (p = 3.4 x 10(-8)), and weight (p = 9.1 x 10(-7)). In Sardinia, homozygotes for the rare "G" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.46) were 1.3 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common "A" allele. Within the PFKP gene, rs6602024 showed very strong association with BMI (p = 4.9 x 10(-6)). Homozygotes for the rare "A" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.12) were 1.8 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common "G" allele. To replicate our findings, we genotyped these two SNPs in the GenNet study. In European Americans (N = 1,496) and in Hispanic Americans (N = 839), we replicated significant association between rs9930506 in the FTO gene and BMI (p-value for meta-analysis of European American and Hispanic American follow-up samples, p = 0.001), weight (p = 0.001), and hip circumference (p = 0.0005). We did not replicate association between rs6602024 and obesity-related traits in the GenNet sample, although we found that in European Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans, homozygotes for the rare "A" allele were, on average, 1.0-3.0 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the more common "G" allele. In summary, we have completed a whole genome-association scan for three obesity-related quantitative traits and report that common genetic variants in the FTO gene are associated with substantial changes in BMI, hip circumference, and body weight. These changes could have a significant impact on the risk of obesity-related morbidity in the general population.');

We aimed to characterize 19 such loci using detailed measures of insulin processing, secretion, and sensitivity to help elucidate their role in regulation of glucose control, insulin secretion and/or action. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We investigated associations of loci identified by the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) with circulating proinsulin, measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), euglycemic clamps, insulin suppression tests, or frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests in nondiabetic humans (n = 29,084). RESULTS The glucose-raising allele in MADD was associated with abnormal insulin processing (a dramatic effect on higher proinsulin levels, but no association with insulinogenic index) at extremely persuasive levels of statistical significance (P = 2.1 x 10(-71)). Defects in insulin processing and insulin secretion were seen in glucose-raising allele carriers at TCF7L2, SCL30A8, GIPR, and C2CD4B. Abnormalities in early insulin secretion were suggested in glucose-raising allele carriers at MTNR1B, GCK, FADS1, DGKB, and PROX1 (lower insulinogenic index; no association with proinsulin or insulin sensitivity). Two loci previously associated with fasting insulin (GCKR and IGF1) were associated with OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity indices in a consistent direction. CONCLUSIONS Genetic loci identified through their effect on hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in associations with measures of insulin processing, secretion, and sensitivity. Our findings emphasize the importance of detailed physiological characterization of such loci for improved understanding of pathways associated with alterations in glucose homeostasis and eventually type 2 diabetes.');

These factors included donor age, cerebrovascular accident as the cause of death, renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL), and history of hypertension. Expanded donor kidneys were defined as those with relative risk of graft loss greater than 1.70 and included all donors aged 60 years and older and those aged 50 to 59 years with at least two of the other three conditions (cerebrovascular cause of death, renal insufficiency, hypertension). The expanded donor group accounted for 14.8% of transplanted kidneys. Among organs procured from expanded donors, 38% were discarded versus 9% for all other kidneys. The risk of graft loss of expanded donor kidneys was increased in both older and younger recipients but to a greater extent in those recipients older than 50 years.By identifying donor factors associated with graft failure, these analyses may help to expand the number of transplanted kidneys by increasing the utilization of retrieved cadaveric kidneys.');

The risk was dependent on the length of time from pregnancy to RT, with women receiving RT during pregnancy and within 1 month of pregnancy having an increased risk of breast cancer compared with nonpregnant women and women irradiated later than 1 month after pregnancy (hazard ratio, 22.49; 95% confidence interval, 5.56-90.88; p <0.001).The results of this study indicate that the risk of breast cancer after RT is greater with irradiation around the time of pregnancy. This suggests that pregnancy is a time of increased sensitivity of breast tissue to the carcinogenic effects of radiation. Because of the small sample size and limited follow-up, additional studies are recommended to confirm these findings.');

The patients were HIV-infected with pretreatment CD4 < or =50 cells/mm3 and various degrees of prior zidovudine (ZDV) use. Double-blind, three-arm randomized control trials ACTG 116a and ACTG 116b/117 compared ZDV with didanosine (ddI). ACTG 155 compared ZDV with zalcitabine or combination therapy. Our validation study, ACTG 118, compared the effects of three different doses of ddI on survival. The main outcome measures were survival and mortality. The three studies combined enrolled 699 patients with entry CD4 T-lymphocyte counts of < or =50 cells/mm3. Forty percent of patients died during follow-up, with a median survival of 19.7 months. Multivariate analysis showed shorter survival at p < 0.0001 with lower CD4 count (relative hazard [RH] = 0.98) and lower hemoglobin level (RH = 0.81). Other factors included older age (RH = 1.03), male gender (RH = 1.70), Hispanic ethnicity (RH = 1.68), and symptomatic disease stage (RH = 2.06). Our predictive mortality risk model differentiated well patients with differing risks of mortality. When the risk model was applied to ACTG 118, the validation data set, the identified prognostic factors could distinguish patients with varying risks of death (p < 0.001, stratified log-rank test). These results demonstrate that CD4 T-lymphocytes counts < or =50 cells/mm3 should not be considered a precursor of imminent death; considerable variability in survival exists in severely immunocompromised patients. Our identification of prognostic indicators for survival can aid clinicians and patients in management of their disease and researchers in design of future clinical trials.');

Among the 58 loci, 33 exhibited evidence of association at P<1 Ã 10(-4) in at least one ancestry group. Sequential conditional analyses revealed that ten, nine, and four loci in African Americans, Europeans, and East Asians, respectively, exhibited two or more signals. At these loci, accounting for all signals led to a 1.3- to 1.8-fold increase in the explained phenotypic variance compared to the strongest signals. Distinct signals across ancestry groups were identified at PCSK9 and APOA5. Trans-ethnic analyses narrowed the signals to smaller sets of variants at GCKR, PPP1R3B, ABO, LCAT, and ABCA1. Of 27 variants reported previously to have functional effects, 74% exhibited the strongest association at the respective signal.

The association of CRP with mortality was evaluated using Cox regression. Prediction of 1-year mortality was assessed in logistic regression models with differing adjustment variables.Median baseline CRP was lower in Japan (1.0 mg/L) than other countries (6.0 mg/L). CRP was positively, monotonically associated with mortality. No threshold below which mortality rate leveled off was identified. In prediction models, CRP performance was comparable with albumin and exceeded ferritin and white blood cell (WBC) count based on measures of model discrimination (c-statistics, net reclassification improvement [NRI]) and global model fit (generalized R(2)).

We identified 171 distinct genes at least 1.5-fold up-regulated (and P < 0.001) in the SCCs relative to HSILs and normal cervix samples.

Using national data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we compare transplant and wait-list hospitalization rates. Hospitalizations are subject to two levels of dependence. In addition to the dependence among within-patient events, patients are also clustered by listing center. We propose two marginal methods to analyze such clustered recurrent event data; the first model postulates a common baseline event rate, while the second features cluster-specific baseline rates. Our results indicate that kidney transplantation offers a significant decrease in hospitalization, but that the effect is negated by a waiting time (until transplant) of more than 2 years. Moreover, graft failure (GF) results in a significant increase in the hospitalization rate which is greatest in the first month post-GF, but remains significantly elevated up to 4 years later.

Data from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (1984-1989) were used to investigate the association between socioeconomic and psychosocial exposures across the life course and binge drinking in a population-based sample of 2,316 middle-aged men. Binge drinking was defined as drinking at least four bottles of beer, one bottle of wine, one bottle of strong wine, or six servings of spirits on a single occasion. A composite indicator of childhood socioeconomic position was based on parental education, occupation, and number of rooms and divided into tertiles. Low childhood socioeconomic position increased the odds of binge drinking (odds ratio = 1.70, 95% confidence interval: 1.26, 2.31) when other early life exposures were adjusted. Additional adjustment of adult socioeconomic and psychosocial factors attenuated the odds of bingeing associated with low childhood socioeconomic position (odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.79). Adult socioeconomic conditions, marital status, hostility, and organizational membership were independently associated with bingeing. This study shows that both early and later life characteristics including socioeconomic conditions and adult psychosocial factors contribute to adult binge drinking in this population, but the effects of adult characteristics are stronger.');

Additional Lucite wedges were used to simulate two different body thicknesses and to provide variable structural noise. Soft-tissue-equivalent nodules of 3-mm and 5-mm diameter that resulted in 10% differences in attenuation from lung equivalence were embedded in lung-equivalent material. By superimposing the sheets in various positions, 84 unique nodule configurations containing eight nodules per image were exposed on a computed radiography system. Computed radiographs were acquired at two different exposures approximating standard exposure and underexposure. For each resulting phantom image, seven observers scored the presence or absence of a nodule within individual cells of a 5 x 5 grid matrix.True-positive fractions for 3-mm-diameter nodules were very low across all conditions. True-positive fractions for 5-mm-diameter nodules varied from 0.23 to 0.98. Significant differences in the conspicuity of 5-mm nodules depended on differences in phantom thickness and differences in the locations of nodules within lung-, retrocardiac-, or subdiaphragmatic-equivalent regions. Accuracy in detecting nodules was significantly lower at lower exposures when nodules were located in the subdiaphragmatic-equivalent region.On computed radiographs, small nodules (5-mm diameter) can be reliably detected when they are located in areas of high or moderate surrounding local contrast, such as the lung or mediastinal regions. Detection of nodules decreases in regions of lower optical density corresponding to the subdiaphragmatic regions of the chest. The decrease in nodule detectability is greatest under conditions that simulate large body thickness and underexposure.');

We report on the risk factors for death after retransplantation among liver recipients with HCV. A retrospective cohort of liver transplant recipients who underwent retransplantation between January 1997 and December 2002 was identified in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database. Cox regression was used to assess the relative effect of HCV diagnosis on mortality risk after retransplantation and was adjusted for multiple covariates. Of 1,718 liver retransplantations during the study period, 464 (27%) were associated with a diagnosis of HCV infection. Based on Cox regression, retransplant recipients with HCV had a 30% higher covariate-adjusted mortality risk than those without HCV diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.54; P = 0.002). Other covariates associated with significant relative risk of death after retransplantation included older recipient age, presence in an intensive care unit (ICU), serum creatinine, and donor age. Additional regression analysis revealed that the increase in mortality risk associated with HCV was concentrated between 3 and 24 months postretransplantation, among patients age 18 to 39 at retransplant, and in patients retransplanted during the years 2000 to 2002. In conclusion, HCV liver recipients account for a considerable proportion of all retransplantations performed. Surprisingly, younger age predicted a higher mortality for recipients with HCV undergoing liver retransplantation. This may reflect a willingness to retransplant younger patients with an increased severity of illness or a more virulent HCV infection in this population. Although HCV was predictive of an increased risk of death, consideration of other characteristics of HCV patients, including donor and recipient age and need for preoperative ICU care may identify those at significantly higher risk.');

Racial differences in the pattern of rising PSA would warrant different intervention strategies for reducing the disproportionality in survival outcomes between the two racial groups.Between 1991-1996, 1080 consecutive men underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized PC at Wayne State University-affiliated Harper Hospital. Two hundred forty-one patients developed a biochemical recurrence on or before January, 1, 1999. The median follow-up was 39 months. Longitudinal PSA profiles of 77 men who met the study inclusion criteria were analyzed. Average relative velocities of PSA were compared between AAM and WM. Linear mixed effects regression was used to test the hypothesis that, after adjusting for age, preoperative PSA, stage and grade of disease, PSA levels increase at a faster rate in AAM compared with WM.The mean average relative velocity for AAM and WM experiencing a disease recurrence was 0.25 ng/mL and 0.11 ng/mL per month, respectively (P = 0.21).

A population-based matched case-control analysis was used to investigate associations between acute asthma outcomes and proximity of residence to major roads, including freeways. Asthma cases were identified as all children who made at least one asthma claim, including inpatient and emergency department visits, during the three-year study period, 2004-06. Individually matched controls were randomly selected from the rest of the Medicaid population on the basis of non-respiratory related illness. We used conditional logistic regression with distance as both categorical and continuous variables, and examined non-linear relationships with distance using polynomial splines. The conditional logistic regression models were then extended by considering multiple asthma states (based on the frequency of acute asthma outcomes) using polychotomous conditional logistic regression.Asthma events were associated with proximity to primary roads with an odds ratio of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.99) for a 1 km increase in distance using conditional logistic regression, implying that asthma events are less likely as the distance between the residence and a primary road increases. Similar relationships and effect sizes were found using polychotomous conditional logistic regression. Another plausible exposure metric, a reduced form response surface model that represents atmospheric dispersion of pollutants from roads, was not associated under that exposure model.There is moderately strong evidence of elevated risk of asthma close to major roads based on the results obtained in this population-based matched case-control study.');

Dates of preentry seroconversion in HIV-1 seroprevalent men were estimated using study entry values of hematologic variables influenced by HIV-1 infection. The authors used survival methods incorporating truncation to determine numbers/dates of seroconversion for men with a pre-1984 AIDS diagnosis who were selectively excluded by design from the 1984 AIDS-free cohort. Overall, the annual seroconversion hazard rose progressively from 0.4% in 1978 to 13.8% in 1983, dropped to 4.6% in 1985, and remained relatively stable at 1.1-2.2% from 1986 to 1990. By January 1990, almost 46% of men who were seronegative in 1978 had seroconverted. The authors estimated historical rates of spread by city, age, education, and ethnicity to examine the effects of these factors in the early and continuing stages of the HIV-1 epidemic. There were striking differences among cities with respect to pre-1985 seroconversion rates but not with respect to post-1985 seroconversion rates. Age, education, and ethnicity were all associated with 1978-1990 seroconversion rates. Future seroconversion among homosexual men was predicted assuming that the "stabilized" 1986-1990 hazards (stratified by age) observed here will be representative of future rates.

We performed a comprehensive assessment of the methods applied to both trios and to unrelated individuals, with a focus on genomic-scale problems, using both simulated data and data from the HapMap project. The most accurate algorithm was PHASE (v2.1). For this method, the percentages of genotypes whose phase was incorrectly inferred were 0.12%, 0.05%, and 0.16% for trios from simulated data, HapMap Centre d''Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) trios, and HapMap Yoruban trios, respectively, and 5.2% and 5.9% for unrelated individuals in simulated data and the HapMap CEPH data, respectively.

We thus conclude that all the methods considered will provide highly accurate estimates of haplotypes when applied to trio data sets. Running times differ substantially between methods. Although it is one of the slowest methods, PHASE (v2.1) was used to infer haplotypes for the 1 million-SNP HapMap data set.

Exclusion criteria were subjects younger than 25 years old, stroke attributable to head trauma, and non-Durango Municipality residents. Brain Attack Surveillance in Durango-trained neurologists validated cases as stroke using source documentation. Stroke hospitalization rates were defined to include patients examined in the emergency department or admitted to the hospital.Abstractors identified 435 potential cases; 309 (71%) were validated as stroke. Of the validated stroke cases, the median age was 71 and 49% were female. Subtypes were 61.5% ischemic stroke, 20.7% intracerebral hemorrhage, 7.4% subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 10.4% undetermined. Overall initial NIHSS was a median of 11 (interquartile range, 7-17); in-hospital mortality was 39%. When adjusted to the world population, the age-adjusted hospitalization rate of first-ever stroke was 118.2 per 100 000; rates by type were: ischemic stroke, 69.1 (95% CI, 57.5-80.7); intracerebral hemorrhage, 26.7 (95% CI, 19.6-33.8); subarachnoid hemorrhage, 9.5 (95% CI, 5.3-13.8); and unknown, 12.3 (95% CI, 7.4-17.3).

Means of the O*NET noise scores were computed to correspond to NHANES occupational categories and assigned to 3828 adults aged 20-69 years, who participated in the 1999-2004 NHANES. Pure-tone averages (PTA) of hearing thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz were computed, and hearing loss was defined as a PTA >25 dB in either ear. Linear and logistic regression models with either continuous or quintiles of the O*NET noise scores were fitted on log-transformed PTA and binary hearing loss, respectively.Noise scores ranged from 1.80 to 4.37 with meanÂ±SE of 3.06Â±0.02. After controlling for potential confounders, the highest (vs lowest) noise score quintile had a 22.5% (95% CI 11.0% to 35.2%) increase in PTA, and there was a linear dose-dependent trend across the quintiles of noise scores (p trend<0.0001). The adjusted OR for hearing loss comparing the highest with the lowest noise score quintiles was 2.1 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.6).This study suggests that the O*NET noise score is a useful tool for examining occupational noise-induced health effects in the general population in the absence of actual occupational noise exposure assessment data.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(528,18546703,'Deposition of pollutants around point sources of contamination, such as incinerators, can display complex spatial patterns depending on prevailing weather conditions, the local topography, and the characteristics of the source. Deterministic dispersion models often fail to capture the complexity observed in the field, resulting in uncertain predictions that might hamper subsequent decision-making, such as delineation of areas targeted for additional sampling or remediation. This paper describes a geostatistical simulation-based methodology that combines the detailed process-based modeling of atmospheric deposition from an incinerator with the probabilistic modeling of residual variability of field samples. The approach is used to delineate areas with high levels of dioxin TEQ(DF)-WHO98 (toxic equivalents) around an incinerator, accounting for 53 field data and the output of the EPA Industrial Source Complex (ISC3) dispersion model. The dispersion model explains 43.7% of the variance in the soil TEQ data, whereas the regression residuals are spatially correlated with a range of 776 m. One hundred realizations of soil TEQ values are simulated on a grid with a 50 m spacing. The benefit of stochastic simulation over spatial interpolation is 2-fold: (1) maps of simulated point TEQ values can easily be aggregated to the geography that is the most relevant for decision making (e.g., census block, ZIP codes); and (2) the uncertainty at the larger scale is simply modeled by the empirical distribution of block-averaged simulated values. Incorporating the output of the atmospheric deposition model as a spatial trend yields a more realistic prediction of the spatial distribution of TEQ values than log-normal kriging using only the field data, in particular, in sparsely sampled areas away from the incinerator. The geostatistical model provided guidance for the study design (census block-based population sampling) of the University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study (UMDES), focused on quantifying exposure pathways to dioxins from industrial sources, relative to background exposures.');

For each of the participating HMOs, the functional health status of recent Medicare enrollees was compared with that of a control group of randomly chosen fee-for-service beneficiaries. None of the HMOs experienced adverse selection, whether measured in terms of overall (mean) health status of enrollees or in terms of the proportion of the very disabled population that chose to join. Nine of the 22 HMOs were considered to have experienced favorable selection on the basis of the mean health status of new enrollees. In addition, ten more HMOs were found to have experienced favorable selection in one or both tails of the health status distribution. Although a specific cause for the observed enrollment patterns is not identified, speculation is made on factors that may or may not contribute. Evidence suggests that beneficiary self-selection is probably a more important explanation of these patterns than purposeful actions of HMOs to discourage enrollment by sicker beneficiaries (i.e., "skimming").');

In addition, pulsatile characteristics of corticotropin and cortisol were assessed over a 12-hr period (0800 to 2000 hr).Eleven abstinent alcohol-dependent men and 10 healthy comparison participants were assessed. All participants were between the ages of 30 and 50 years, and alcohol-dependent patients were abstinent from 4 to 6 weeks. Basal concentrations of corticotropin and cortisol were obtained every 10 min from 0800 to 2000 hr and subjected to pulsatile analysis. Plasma corticotropin and cortisol concentrations were then obtained every 5 to 10 min after low-dose, intravenously administered doses of oCRH (0.4 microg/kg) or naloxone (0.125 mg/kg). Medications were administered at 2000 hr and the two challenge studies were separated by 48 hr.Pulsatile analysis revealed that the mean corticotropin amplitude was increased in alcohol-dependent patients relative to controls (p <0.05). Other pulsatile characteristics of corticotropin and all cortisol pulsatile measures were not significantly different between the two groups. The integrated cortisol response to oCRH was significantly lower in alcohol-dependent patients compared with controls (p <0.01), but the integrated corticotropin response was not significantly different. In contrast, neither the corticotropin nor the cortisol response to naloxone was significantly different between groups.Adrenocorticoid hyposensitivity persists after oCRH infusion for at least 1 month after cessation of drinking, whereas hyporesponsiveness of the pituitary corticotrophs to CRH seems to resolve with continued abstinence. The authors suggest that adrenocortical hyporesponsiveness during prolonged abstinence may impact relapse risk.');

In this first of a two-part study, the authors report on (1) the basal secretory profile of corticotropin and cortisol from 2000 to 0800 hrs, (2) adrenocortical sensitivity in both the presence and absence of endogenous pituitary activation, and (3) pituitary glucocorticoid sensitivity to dexamethasone.Eleven male, 4 to 6 weeks abstinent, alcohol-only-dependent subjects and 10 age-matched male healthy controls were studied. Basal circulating concentrations of corticotropin and cortisol were obtained from 2000 to 0800 hr. A submaximal dose of cosyntropin (0.01 microg/kg), a corticotropin analogue was then administered to assess adrenocortical sensitivity. In a separate session, cosyntropin was administered following high-dose dexamethasone (8 mg iv) to assess adrenocortical sensitivity in the relative absence of endogenous corticotropin. In addition, the corticotropin response to dexamethasone was measured to determine pituitary glucocorticoid responsiveness.Cortisol, but not corticotropin, pulse amplitude (p < 0.05) and mean concentration (p= 0.05) was significantly lower in alcohol-dependent subjects compared with controls. The cortisol response to cosyntropin was lower in alcohol-dependent subjects following endogenous corticotropin suppression by high-dose dexamethasone (p <0.04) but not without dexamethasone pretreatment. Mean corticotropin (p <0.004) and cortisol (p <0.05) concentrations in response to dexamethasone were attenuated in the patients compared to controls. Basal concentrations of 11-deoxycortisol, the precursor to cortisol, were also decreased in alcohol-dependent subjects (p <0.05).Attenuated basal and stimulated adrenocortical concentrations in abstinent alcohol-dependent men are coupled with a nonhomeostatic increase in pituitary glucocorticoid inhibition. A decrease in stress-axis responsivity in alcohol dependence may have implications for treatment outcome.');

Over the past decade, many of the signaling cascades that regulate this lineage have been elucidated; however, little is known of the networks that coordinate, modulate, and transmit these signals. Here, we identify a gene network specific to the osteoblast-lineage through the reconstruction of a bone co-expression network using microarray profiles collected on 96 Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) inbred strains. Of the 21 modules that comprised the bone network, module 9 (M9) contained genes that were highly correlated with prototypical osteoblast maker genes and were more highly expressed in osteoblasts relative to other bone cells. In addition, the M9 contained many of the key genes that define the osteoblast-lineage, which together suggested that it was specific to this lineage. To use the M9 to identify novel osteoblast genes and highlight its biological relevance, we knocked-down the expression of its two most connected "hub" genes, Maged1 and Pard6g. Their perturbation altered both osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated the mice deficient in Maged1 had decreased bone mineral density (BMD). It was also discovered that a local expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) regulating the Wnt signaling antagonist Sfrp1 was a key driver of the M9. We also show that the M9 is associated with BMD in the HMDP and is enriched for genes implicated in the regulation of human BMD through genome-wide association studies. In conclusion, we have identified a physiologically relevant gene network and used it to discover novel genes and regulatory mechanisms involved in the function of osteoblast-lineage cells. Our results highlight the power of harnessing natural genetic variation to generate co-expression networks that can be used to gain insight into the function of specific cell-types.');

The limited power of classical single-marker association analysis for rare variants poses a central challenge in such studies. We propose the sequence kernel association test (SKAT), a supervised, flexible, computationally efficient regression method to test for association between genetic variants (common and rare) in a region and a continuous or dichotomous trait while easily adjusting for covariates. As a score-based variance-component test, SKAT can quickly calculate p values analytically by fitting the null model containing only the covariates, and so can easily be applied to genome-wide data. Using SKAT to analyze a genome-wide sequencing study of 1000 individuals, by segmenting the whole genome into 30 kb regions, requires only 7 hr on a laptop. Through analysis of simulated data across a wide range of practical scenarios and triglyceride data from the Dallas Heart Study, we show that SKAT can substantially outperform several alternative rare-variant association tests. We also provide analytic power and sample-size calculations to help design candidate-gene, whole-exome, and whole-genome sequence association studies.');

However, our interest lies not only in estimating the fixed covariate effects but also in estimating the random effects parameters that account for varying correlations among family members. These random effects parameters, though weakly identifiable in a strict theoretical sense, are often hard to estimate due to the small number of observations per family. A hierarchical Bayesian paradigm is a very natural route in this context with multiple advantages compared with a classical mixed effects estimation strategy based on the integrated likelihood. We propose a fully flexible Bayesian approach allowing nonparametric modeling of the random effects distribution using a Dirichlet process prior and provide estimation of both fixed effect and random effects parameters using a Markov chain Monte Carlo numerical integration scheme. The nonparametric Bayesian approach not only provides inference that is less sensitive to parametric specification of the random effects distribution but also allows possible uncertainty around a specific genetic correlation structure. The Bayesian approach has certain computational advantages over its mixed-model counterparts. Data from the Prostate Cancer Genetics Project, a family-based study at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center including families having one or more members with prostate cancer, are used to illustrate the proposed methods.

We extend the results to accommodate clustered censored discrete time-to-event data. We next consider such tests in the situation where covariates are measured with errors. We propose using the SIMEX method to construct the score tests for the null hypothesis that the variance components are zero. Key advantages of the proposed score tests are that they can be easily implemented by fitting standard polytomous regression models and discrete failure time models, and that they are robust in the sense that no assumptions need to be made regarding the distributions of the random effects and the unobserved covariates.

We utilized data from 4,954 homosexual/bisexual men followed over 6 years, with CD4 testing at 6 month intervals, to study the timing of CD4-based staging of HIV-1 disease and quantify and evaluate the potential impact of CD4 measurement error. The median time from seroconversion to first CD4 test below 500 x 10(6)/L or clinical AIDS was 1.70 years, and the first CD4 test below 200 x 10(6)/L or clinical AIDs was 5.29 years. The time from first testing less than 500 x 10(6)/L to clinical AIDS in untreated men was 5.55 years. With confirmatory retesting, these times were significantly lengthened.

Reduction or loss of CCN6 protein has been reported in invasive carcinomas of the breast with lymph node metastasis and in inflammatory breast cancer. However, the mechanism by which CCN6 loss promotes breast cancer growth remains to be defined. In the present study, we developed lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA CCN6 knockdown (KD) in nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells MCF10A and HME. We discovered that CCN6 KD protects mammary epithelial cells from apoptosis and activates growth factor-independent survival. In the absence of exogenous growth factors, CCN6 KD was able to promote growth under anchorage-independent conditions and triggered resistance to detachment-induced cell death (anoikis). On serum starvation, CCN6 KD was sufficient for activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Growth factor-independent cell survival was stunted in CCN6 KD cells when treated with either human recombinant CCN6 protein or the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Targeted inhibition of Akt isoforms revealed that the survival advantage rendered by CCN6 KD requires specific activation of Akt-1. The relevance of our studies to human breast cancer is highlighted by the finding that low CCN6 protein levels are associated with upregulated expression of phospho-Akt-1 (Ser(473)) in 21% of invasive breast carcinomas. These results enable us to pinpoint one mechanism by which CCN6 controls survival of breast cells mediated by the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway.');

If the model assumptions of doubling time heterogeneity are correct, the difference between a short and protracted radiation regimen would be not only in the position and steepness of the radiation dose-response curve, but also in the level of the predicted plateau.For a given rate of dose accumulation, the one-sided flattening in dose-response curves at high doses is predicted from the modeling, and determined by the proportion of most radioresistant and rapidly growing tumors.

Its increasing success has been accompanied by progressive imbalance between organ donor supply and the patients who might benefit. Where demand outstrips supply in transplantation, a system of organ allocation is inevitably required to make the wisest use of the available, but scarce, organs. Early attempts to rationally allocate donor livers were particularly hampered by lack of available and suitable data, leading to imperfect solutions that created or exacerbated inequities in the system. The advent and maturation of evidence-based predictors of waiting list mortality risk led to more objective criteria for liver allocation, aided by the increasing availability of data on large numbers of patients. Until now, the vast majority of allocation systems for liver transplantation have relied on estimation of waiting list mortality. Evidence-based allocation systems that incorporate measures of post-transplant outcomes are conceptually attractive and these transplant benefit-based allocation systems have been developed, modeled, and subjected to computer simulation. Future implementations of benefit-based liver allocation await continued refinement and additional debate in the transplant community.');

Using the TREMIN data set (1943-1979), the authors apply a bayesian change-point model with 8 parameters for each woman that summarize change in menstrual bleeding patterns during the menopausal transition. The authors then use estimates from this model to classify menstrual patterns into subgroups using a K-medoids algorithm. They identify 6 subgroups of women whose transition experience can be distinguished by age at onset, variability of the menstrual cycle, and duration of the early transition. These results suggest that for most women, mean and variance change points are well aligned with proposed bleeding markers of the menopausal transition, but for some women they are not clearly associated. Increasing understanding of population differences in the transition experience may lead to new insights into ovarian aging.

Rate of weight gain and initiation of estrous behavior were also monitored. After the first breeding season, when the animals entered anestrus, competency of the gonadotropin surge system to respond to estradiol positive feedback was tested in the absence or presence of progesterone priming for 12 days. Prenatally androgenized females had similar body weight gain and achieved puberty (start of first progestogenic cycle) at the same time as controls. Duration of the breeding season and the number of cycles that occurred during the first breeding season were similar between control and prenatally androgenized sheep. In contrast, prenatal exposure to androgens compromised the positive feedback effects of estradiol. Onset of LH/FSH surges following the estradiol stimulus was delayed in both groups of androgenized ewes compared with the controls in both the absence and presence of progesterone priming. In addition, the magnitude of LH and FSH surges in the two animals that surged in the D30-90 group were only one third and one half, respectively, of the magnitudes observed in the control and D60-90 groups.

The increased basal BP was attenuated by the centrally acting Î±2a agonist guanfacine, suggesting a role of increased sympathetic tone in CAPs exposure-induced hypertension. The increase in sympathetic tone was accompanied by an inflammatory response in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, evidenced by increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and inhibitor kappaB kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-ÎºB) pathway activation.Long-term CAPs exposure increases BP through sympathetic nervous system activation, which may involve hypothalamic inflammation.');

Patients were grouped as single or double lung recipients and segregated into diagnostic categories according to the lung allocation scoring system.

Overall survivals at 3 months and 1, 3, and 5 years were 89%, 79%, 60%, and 52%, respectively. After adjusting for lung recipient characteristics, survival after double lung transplantation was improved when compared with single lung transplantation (P = .020). Overall patient survival among the three time periods was not significantly different at 30 days and 1 and 3 years despite increasing maximal donor organ ischemia times.In this single-center study, despite longer median allograft ischemic times, as well as greater patient acuity as determined by listing diagnosis, overall early and midterm patient survival has remained higher than nationally reported figures.

These were undertaken at the University of Pennsylvania by a multi-disciplinary team of economists, statisticians and epidemiologists with the support of the US Environmental Protection Agency and its Office of Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response (OEPPR, formerly CEPPO). Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires that chemical facilities in the US that had on premises more than specified quantities of toxic or flammable chemicals file a 5-year history of accidents. The initial data reported under the RMP Rule covered roughly the period from mid-1994 through mid-2000, and provided details on economic, environmental and acute health affects resulting from accidents at some 15,000 US chemical facilities for this period. This paper reviews research based on this data. The research is in the form of a retrospective cohort study that considers the statistical associations between accident frequency and accident severity at covered facilities (the outcome variables of interest) and a number of facility characteristics (the available predictor variables provided by the RMP Rule), the latter including such facility characteristics as size, hazardousness, financial characteristics of parent company-owners of the facility, regulatory programs in force at the facility, and host community characteristics for the surrounding county in which the facility was located, as captured in the 1990 Census. Among the findings reviewed are: (1) positive associations with (a measure of) facility hazardousness and accident, injury and economic costs of accidents; (2) positive (resp., negative) associations between accident propensity and debt-equity ratios (resp., sales) of parent companies; (3) several interrelated associations between accident propensity and regulatory programs in force; and (4) strong associations between facility hazardousness, facility locations decisions, observed accident frequencies and community demographics.');

Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) were quantified by ultrasound, and coronary calcification by computed tomography. Serum vascular biomarkers were measured by ELISA. We evaluated the effect of type I IFNs on FMD, CIMT and coronary calcification by first applying principal components analysis to combine data from five IFIGs into summary components that could be simultaneously modeled. Three components were derived explaining 97.1% of the total IFIG variation. Multivariable linear regression was utilized to investigate the association between the three components and other covariates, with the outcomes of FMD and CIMT; zero-inflated Poisson regression was used for modeling of coronary calcification. After controlling for traditional CV risk factors, enhanced serum IFN activity was significantly associated with decreased endothelial function in SLE patients and controls (p<0.05 for component 3), increased CIMT among SLE patients (p<0.01 for components 1 and 2), and severity of coronary calcification among SLE patients (p<0.001 for component 3).Type I IFNs are independently associated with atherosclerosis development in lupus patients without history of overt CVD and after controlling for Framingham risk factors.

Using stringent selection criteria of at least 10-fold higher expression in three distinct preparations, we identified 154 RPE signature genes, which were validated by qRT-PCR analysis in RPE and in an independent set of 11 tissues. Several of the highly expressed signature genes encode proteins involved in visual cycle, melanogenesis and cell adhesion and Gene ontology analysis enabled the assignment of RPE signature genes to epithelial channels and transporters (ClCN4, BEST1, SLCA20) or matrix remodeling (TIMP3, COL8A2). Fifteen RPE signature genes were associated with known ophthalmic diseases, and 25 others were mapped to regions of disease loci.

Being the most common haplotype H1 confers the greatest risk by increasing the odds of AMD by 2.75-fold (95% CIâ=â[2.51, 3.01]; pâ=â8.31Ã10(-109)); Caucasian (H6) and Indian-specific (H7) recombinant haplotypes increase the odds of AMD by 1.85-fold (pâ=â3.52Ã10(-9)) and by 15.57-fold (Pâ=â0.007), respectively. We identified a 32-kb region downstream of Y402H (rs1061170), shared by all three risk haplotypes, suggesting that this region may be critical for AMD development. Further analysis showed that two SNPs within the 32 kb block, rs1329428 and rs203687, optimally explain disease association. rs1329428 resides in 20 kb unique sequence block, but rs203687 resides in a 12 kb block that is 89% similar to a noncoding region contained in ÎCNP148.

In addition, frequency of Tregs at onset of GVHD predicted the response to GVHD treatment (P = .003). Patients with Treg frequencies less than the median had higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM) than patients with Tregs greater than the median, but experienced equivalent relapse mortality, resulting in an inferior survival at 2 years (38% versus 63%, P = .03).

A., and Hubbard, A. L. (1993) Gastroenterology 105, 554-571). Starting with crude microsomes from the livers of [35S]methionine-labeled rats, we sequentially immunoadsorbed first vesicles containing the endocytic asialoglycoprotein receptor and then (from the depleted supernatant) vesicles containing the polymeric IgA receptor. Biochemical characterization indicated that early basolateral and late endosomes were present in the first population but not in the second. Neither Golgi-, apical plasma membrane (PM)-, nor basolateral PM-derived vesicles were significant contaminants of either population. Both vesicle populations contained 35S-labeled receptor and 35S-labeled-dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Importantly, the elevated relative specific activity of the dipeptidyl peptidase (% of 35S-labeled/% immunoblotted) in the second population indicated that these vesicles must transport newly synthesized dipeptidyl peptidase IV. A distinct kind of vesicle was immunoadsorbed from a "carrier-vesicle fraction"; surprisingly, these vesicles contained little 35S-receptor and virtually no dipeptidyl peptidase IV. These results, together with previous kinetic data from in vivo experiments, are consistent with a computer-generated model predicting that newly synthesized dipeptidyl peptidase IV is delivered to basolateral endosomes, which also contain newly synthesized polymeric immunoglobulin A receptor. The two proteins are then transcytosed together to the subapical region.');

Here we have investigated genetic suppression of FX-mediated lethality. Reduced recovery of heterozygous mice was observed while backcrossing the null FX allele to C57BL/6J (B6), but was less dramatic in an outcross to CASA/Rk and absent in an outcross to 129S1/SvImJ, indicating that genetic background modifies survival of FX+/- progeny. Substantial strain-specific differences in pre- and postnatal survival of FX-/- progeny were also detected in heterozygous crosses of C57BL/6J congenic, 129S1B6F1, and B6CASAF1 mice. Specifically, intrauterine survival of FX-/- mice was greatly increased during a heterozygous intercross on a uniform C57BL/6J genetic background compared with survival on a hybrid genetic background consisting of a mixture of C57BL/6J and 129S2/SvPas. In addition, statistically significant clustering of FX-/- progeny into litters and specific breeding cages was noted during a B6CASAF1 FX+/- intercross, suggesting a rare mechanism for modifier gene action in which parentally expressed genes define the phenotype, in this case the survival potential, of mutant offspring. Our results disclose that lethality in FX mutant mice is determined by one or more strain-specific modifier loci.');

The cellular markers were the number of CD4+ T cells, the number of CD8+ T cells, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells. The serologic markers were the serum levels of neopterin (a product of stimulated macrophages), beta 2-microglobulin, soluble interleukin-2 receptors, IgA, and HIV p24 antigen. We evaluated the usefulness of these measures as markers of the progression to AIDS prospectively, over four years, in a cohort of 395 HIV-seropositive homosexual men who were initially free of AIDS. CD4+ T cells (expressed as an absolute number, a percentage of lymphocytes, or a ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells) were the best single predictor of the progression to AIDS, but the serum neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin levels each had nearly as much predictive power. The neopterin level appeared to be a slightly better predictor than the beta 2-microglobulin level. The levels of IgA, interleukin-2 receptors, and p24 antigen had less predictive value. A stepwise multivariate analysis indicated that the best predictors, in descending order, were CD4+ T cells (the percentage of lymphocytes or the CD4+: CD8+ ratio), the serum level of neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin, the level of IgA, that of interleukin-2 receptors, and that of p24 antigen. The last three markers had little additional predictive power beyond that of the first two. We conclude that of the eight markers studied, progression to AIDS was predicted most accurately by the level of CD4+ T cells in combination with the serum level of either neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin. At least one of these two serum markers, which reflect immune activation, should be used along with measurement of CD4+ T cells in disease-classification schemes and in the evaluation of responses to therapy.');

Failure time statistical regression models for the time to development of AIDS were used to assess prognostic capacity of the parameters alone and in combination.All the markers had prognostic capability. The levels of the three plasma activation markers correlated well with each other (median r = 0.61). They related less well with HIV RNA plasma levels (median r = 0.50) and least well with CD4 cell levels (median r = 0.36). Furthermore, plasma marker levels were shown to be able to stratify patients for prognosis within all the major categories of CD4 T-cell and HIV RNA levels.Plasma levels of soluble TNF-RII and other soluble markers of immune activation have prognostic capabilities which are different from HIV and CD4 T-cell levels. Combination of a single plasma activation marker measurement (such as soluble TNF-RII) with CD4 T-cell levels improved the prognostic capability of each. A new graphic technique for presenting prognostic capability indicated that plasma soluble TNF-RII and CD4 cell levels are better prognostic factors than HIV plasma level with CD4 cells < 200 x 10(6)/l.

Additionally, the influence of depressive symptoms on disease processes is not known. We aimed to address these questions by completing extensive neuropsychological tests with 22 patients with ALS and 17 healthy volunteers. A subgroup of these patients also completed questionnaires to measure depressive and vegetative symptoms. We tested for overall cognitive differences between groups, the influence of physical (e.g., bulbar and limb), vegetative (e.g., fatigue), and depressive symptoms on cognitive performance, and the relationship between depressive symptoms and disease severity in ALS. Overall, patients performed more poorly than healthy controls (HCs), most notably on tests of executive functioning and learning and memory. Results suggest that true cognitive performance differences exist between patients with ALS and HCs, as these differences were not changed by the presence of vegetative or depressive symptoms. There was no effect of limb or bulbar symptoms on cognitive functioning. Also, patients were not any more depressed than HCs, however increased depressive scores correlated with faster disease progression and decreased limb function. Collectively, it is suggested that translational advances in psychological intervention for those with CI and depression become emphasized in future research.');

Third, do particular intervention strategies enhance engagement?To determine: (1) whether engagement (defined by the number of Web sections opened) in a Web-based smoking cessation intervention predicts 6-month abstinence, (2) whether particular sociodemographic and psychographic groups are more likely to have lower engagement, and (3) whether particular components of a Web-based smoking cessation program influence engagement.A randomized trial of 1866 smokers was used to examine the efficacy of 5 different treatment components of a Web-based smoking cessation intervention. The components were: high- versus low-personalized message source, high- versus low-tailored outcome expectation, efficacy expectation, and success story messages. Moreover, the timing of exposure to these sections was manipulated, with participants randomized to either a single unified Web program with all sections available at once, or sequential exposure to each section over a 5-week period of time. Participants from 2 large health plans enrolled to receive the online behavioral smoking cessation program and a free course of nicotine replacement therapy (patch). The program included: an introduction section, a section focusing on outcome expectations, 2 sections focusing on efficacy expectations, and a section with a narrative success story (5 sections altogether, each with multiple screens). Most of the analyses were conducted with a stratification of the 2 exposure types. Measures included: sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics, Web sections opened, perceived message relevance, and smoking cessation 6-months following quit date.The total number of Web sections opened was related to subsequent smoking cessation. Participants who were younger, were male, or had less formal education were more likely to disengage from the Web-based cessation program, particularly when the program sections were delivered sequentially over time.

An asymptotic closed-form distribution of the proposed family of tests is presented, along with variance estimates constructed under null and alternative hypotheses using nonparametric maximum likelihood estimates of the closed-form quantities. The described method allows for additional information from individuals with no corresponding matched pair member to be incorporated into the test statistic in sampling scenarios where singletons are not prone to selection bias. Simulations presented over a range of potential dependence in the paired censored survival data demonstrate substantial power gains associated with taking into account the dependence structure. Consequences of ignoring the paired nature of the data include overly conservative tests in terms of power and size. In fact, simulation results using tests for independent samples in the presence of positive correlation consistently undershot both size and power targets that would have been attained in the absence of correlation.

Baseline and peak troponin values were recorded and were designated as positive if above the cutoff value used at each institution to designate definite myocardial necrosis.In the study cohort, 53.2% of patients presented with baseline positive troponin levels, 30.6% had baseline negative/later positive troponin levels, and 16.2% had negative troponin levels during the entire hospitalization. Patients with baseline positive troponin levels had a higher risk of inhospital mortality than patients with baseline negative/later positive troponin levels (6.5% versus 4.1%) and were less likely to undergo early cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention. The use of acute aspirin (in approximately 91% of patients), heparin (85%), and beta-blockers (78%) was similar in patients with baseline-positive versus later-positive troponin levels.These findings demonstrate that evidence-based therapies and interventions for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes are underused in patients with elevated troponin levels, but baseline troponin elevations, which are associated with a higher risk of inhospital mortality, do not stimulate more aggressive care.');

In order to assess this possibility and to map the NF1 gene more precisely, we have used two polymorphic DNA markers from chromosome 17 to screen several pedigrees for linkage to NF1. We ascertained a large Caucasian pedigree (33 individuals sampled, 17 NF1 affected) as well as eight smaller pedigrees and nuclear families (50 individuals sampled, 30 NF1 affected).

Given the great expense of collecting these families and the imminent availability of a dense diallelic marker map, the families are likely to be used in allelic-association as well as linkage studies. However, optimal selection strategies for linkage may not be equally powerful for association. We examine the power to detect linkage disequilibrium for quantitative traits after phenotypic selection. The results encompass six selection strategies that are in widespread use, including single selection (two designs), affected sib pairs, concordant and discordant pairs, and the extreme-concordant and -discordant design. Selection of sibships on the basis of one extreme proband with high or low trait scores provides as much power as discordant sib pairs but requires the screening and phenotyping of substantially fewer initial families from which to select. Analysis of the role of allele frequencies within each selection design indicates that common trait alleles generally offer the most power, but similarities between the marker- and trait-allele frequencies are much more important than the trait-locus frequency alone. Some of the most widespread selection designs, such as single selection, yield power gains only when both the marker and quantitative trait loci (QTL) are relatively rare in the population. In contrast, discordant pairs and the extreme-proband design provide power for the broadest range of QTL-marker-allele frequency differences. Overall, proband selection from either tail provides the best balance of power, robustness, and simplicity of ascertainment for family-based association analysis.');

The proposed smoothing technique provides both point and interval estimation for the location of local extrema. Also, this technique can be used to test for the hypothesis of either one or multiple suspected locations being the true equilibrium points. We illustrate the proposed method on a microarray data set from an experiment designed to study the replication origins in the yeast genome, in that the locations of autonomous replication sequence (ARS) elements are identified through the equilibrium points of the smoothed intensity profile curve.

This estimate has a smaller asymptotic variance than the usual Kaplan-Meier in the presence of censoring and reduces to the Kaplan-Meier (1958, Journal of the American Statistical Association 53, 457-481) in situations where the covariate is not prognostic or no censoring occurs. In addition, this estimate remains consistent when the incorporated covariate contains information about the censoring process as well as survival information.

In a previous paper we described two methods for estimating the treatment effect, called two-stage and sequential stratification. The two-stage method involved modeling the longitudinal and survival data. The sequential stratification method involves contrasts within matched sets of people, where each matched set includes people who did and did not receive hormone therapy. In this paper, we evaluate the properties of these two methods and compare and contrast them with the marginal structural model methodology.

We highlight the different conditional and marginal interpretations of the quantities being estimated by the three methods. Using simulations that mimic the prostate cancer setting, we evaluate bias, efficiency, and accuracy of estimated standard errors and robustness to modeling assumptions.

In this paper, we seek to quantify differences in the temporalis muscle and the temporal fat pad using a novel CT-derived analytic program to examine craniofacial morphomic indices within these patient groups in comparison to normal age-matched controls. We posit that the temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad, like other derivatives of the first branchial arch, are hypoplastic in patients with TC and PR compared to age-matched controls.High-throughput image analysis was used to reconstruct the 3-dimensional (3D) anatomy and quantify morphomic measures of the temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad in children with PR, TC, and age-matched controls. These steps were completed in a semi-automated method using algorithms programmed in MATLAB v13.0. The 3D reconstructions were analyzed in 3 children with PR (6 temporal regions), 3 children with TC (6 temporal regions), and a control group of 19 children (38 temporal regions). We also quantified the same measurements in a localized "core" sample in the area of greatest thickness, providing a more consistent sample of the tissue position. Relationships between the temporal muscle and fat pad values and craniofacial abnormality type were assessed using Wilcoxon nonparametric test using exact distribution, with a P value of less than 0.05 being deemed significant.The mean age of our patients was 6.0 years in PR and 4.5 years in TC cohorts. We were able to establish an automated methodology to quantify the temporalis muscle and temporal fat pad based on CT characteristics. Localized temporalis volume and localized temporalis area were significantly smaller in children with PR than in the control group. Total temporalis fat volume and localized temporalis area were significantly less in children with TC than in the control group. When compared to each other, the PR group had small morphomic values compared to TC group.There are significant morphomic differences in the temporalis muscle and the temporal fat pad in children with either PR or TC when compared to age-matched control group which can be measured from pre-existing CT scans. Specifically, both of these test groups show decreases in the morphomic measures of the temporalis region. The quantification of these changes corroborates and objectifies the clinical findings associated with these congenital deformities while simultaneously allowing for preoperative planning.

Thus, indoor sources generally contribute the majority of VOC exposures for most people. VOC exposure has been associated with a wide range of acute and chronic health effects; for example, asthma, respiratory diseases, liver and kidney dysfunction, neurologic impairment, and cancer. Although exposures to most VOCs for most persons fall below health-based guidelines, and long-term trends show decreases in ambient emissions and concentrations, a subset of individuals experience much higher exposures that exceed guidelines. Thus, exposure to VOCs remains an important environmental health concern. The present understanding of VOC exposures is incomplete. With the exception of a few compounds, concentration and especially exposure data are limited; and like other environmental data, VOC exposure data can show multiple modes, low and high extreme values, and sometimes a large portion of data below method detection limits (MDLs). Field data also show considerable spatial or interpersonal variability, and although evidence is limited, temporal variability seems high. These characteristics can complicate modeling and other analyses aimed at risk assessment, policy actions, and exposure management. In addition to these analytic and statistical issues, exposure typically occurs as a mixture, and mixture components may interact or jointly contribute to adverse effects. However most pollutant regulations, guidelines, and studies remain focused on single compounds, and thus may underestimate cumulative exposures and risks arising from coexposures. In addition, the composition of VOC mixtures has not been thoroughly investigated, and mixture components show varying and complex dependencies. Finally, although many factors are known to affect VOC exposures, many personal, environmental, and socioeconomic determinants remain to be identified, and the significance and applicability of the determinants reported in the literature are uncertain. To help answer these unresolved questions and overcome limitations of previous analyses, this project used several novel and powerful statistical modeling and analysis techniques and two large data sets. The overall objectives of this project were (1) to identify and characterize exposure distributions (including extreme values), (2) evaluate mixtures (including dependencies), and (3) identify determinants of VOC exposure. METHODS VOC data were drawn from two large data sets: the Relationships of Indoor, Outdoor, and Personal Air (RIOPA) study (1999-2001) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 1999-2000). The RIOPA study used a convenience sample to collect outdoor, indoor, and personal exposure measurements in three cities (Elizabeth, NJ; Houston, TX; Los Angeles, CA). In each city, approximately 100 households with adults and children who did not smoke were sampled twice for 18 VOCs. In addition, information about 500 variables associated with exposure was collected. The NHANES used a nationally representative sample and included personal VOC measurements for 851 participants. NHANES sampled 10 VOCs in common with RIOPA. Both studies used similar sampling methods and study periods. Specific Aim 1. To estimate and model extreme value exposures, extreme value distribution models were fitted to the top 10% and 5% of VOC exposures. Health risks were estimated for individual VOCs and for three VOC mixtures. Simulated extreme value data sets, generated for each VOC and for fitted extreme value and lognormal distributions, were compared with measured concentrations (RIOPA observations) to evaluate each model''s goodness of fit. Mixture distributions were fitted with the conventional finite mixture of normal distributions and the semi-parametric Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) of normal distributions for three individual VOCs (chloroform, 1,4-DCB, and styrene). Goodness of fit for these full distribution models was also evaluated using simulated data. Specific Aim 2. Mixtures in the RIOPA VOC data set were identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF) and by toxicologic mode of action. Dependency structures of a mixture''s components were examined using mixture fractions and were modeled using copulas, which address correlations of multiple components across their entire distributions. Five candidate copulas (Gaussian, t, Gumbel, Clayton, and Frank) were evaluated, and the performance of fitted models was evaluated using simulation and mixture fractions. Cumulative cancer risks were calculated for mixtures, and results from copulas and multivariate lognormal models were compared with risks based on RIOPA observations. Specific Aim 3. Exposure determinants were identified using stepwise regressions and linear mixed-effects models (LMMs).Specific Aim 1. Extreme value exposures in RIOPA typically were best fitted by three-parameter generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions, and sometimes by the two-parameter Gumbel distribution. In contrast, lognormal distributions significantly underestimated both the level and likelihood of extreme values. Among the VOCs measured in RIOPA, 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) was associated with the greatest cancer risks; for example, for the highest 10% of measurements of 1,4-DCB, all individuals had risk levels above 10(-4), and 13% of all participants had risk levels above 10(-2). Of the full-distribution models, the finite mixture of normal distributions with two to four clusters and the DPM of normal distributions had superior performance in comparison with the lognormal models. DPM distributions provided slightly better fit than the finite mixture distributions; the advantages of the DPM model were avoiding certain convergence issues associated with the finite mixture distributions, adaptively selecting the number of needed clusters, and providing uncertainty estimates. Although the results apply to the RIOPA data set, GEV distributions and mixture models appear more broadly applicable. These models can be used to simulate VOC distributions, which are neither normally nor lognormally distributed, and they accurately represent the highest exposures, which may have the greatest health significance. Specific Aim 2. Four VOC mixtures were identified and apportioned by PMF; they represented gasoline vapor, vehicle exhaust, chlorinated solvents and disinfection byproducts, and cleaning products and odorants. The last mixture (cleaning products and odorants) accounted for the largest fraction of an individual''s total exposure (average of 42% across RIOPA participants). Often, a single compound dominated a mixture but the mixture fractions were heterogeneous; that is, the fractions of the compounds changed with the concentration of the mixture. Three VOC mixtures were identified by toxicologic mode of action and represented VOCs associated with hematopoietic, liver, and renal tumors. Estimated lifetime cumulative cancer risks exceeded 10(-3) for about 10% of RIOPA participants. The dependency structures of the VOC mixtures in the RIOPA data set fitted Gumbel (two mixtures) and t copulas (four mixtures). These copula types emphasize dependencies found in the upper and lower tails of a distribution. The copulas reproduced both risk predictions and exposure fractions with a high degree of accuracy and performed better than multivariate lognormal distributions. Specific Aim 3. In an analysis focused on the home environment and the outdoor (close to home) environment, home VOC concentrations dominated personal exposures (66% to 78% of the total exposure, depending on VOC); this was largely the result of the amount of time participants spent at home and the fact that indoor concentrations were much higher than outdoor concentrations for most VOCs. In a different analysis focused on the sources inside the home and outside (but close to the home), it was assumed that 100% of VOCs from outside sources would penetrate the home. Outdoor VOC sources accounted for 5% (d-limonene) to 81% (carbon tetrachloride [CTC]) of the total exposure. Personal exposure and indoor measurements had similar determinants depending on the VOC. Gasoline-related VOCs (e.g., benzene and methyl tert-butyl ether [MTBE]) were associated with city, residences with attached garages, pumping gas, wind speed, and home air exchange rate (AER). Odorant and cleaning-related VOCs (e.g., 1,4-DCB and chloroform) also were associated with city, and a residence''s AER, size, and family members showering. Dry-cleaning and industry-related VOCs (e.g., tetrachloroethylene [or perchloroethylene, PERC] and trichloroethylene [TCE]) were associated with city, type of water supply to the home, and visits to the dry cleaner. These and other relationships were significant, they explained from 10% to 40% of the variance in the measurements, and are consistent with known emission sources and those reported in the literature. Outdoor concentrations of VOCs had only two determinants in common: city and wind speed. Overall, personal exposure was dominated by the home setting, although a large fraction of indoor VOC concentrations were due to outdoor sources. City of residence, personal activities, household characteristics, and meteorology were significant determinants. Concentrations in RIOPA were considerably lower than levels in the nationally representative NHANES for all VOCs except MTBE and 1,4-DCB. Differences between RIOPA and NHANES results can be explained by contrasts between the sampling designs and staging in the two studies, and by differences in the demographics, smoking, employment, occupations, and home locations.

Providers obtained permission for research contact from 81.4% of eligible women, of whom 92.5% agreed to a home visit. All home-visited women consented, giving a net enrolment of 75%. From birth certificates, we estimate that 30% of eligible county pregnancies were enrolled, reaching 40-50% in the final recruitment months.We recruited a high fraction of pregnancies identified in a broad cross-section of provider offices. Nonetheless, because of time and resource constraints, we could enrol only a fraction of geographically eligible pregnancies.

To better understand the relationship between daily cortisol exposure and measures of the diurnal circadian cortisol rhythm, we examined the cross-sectional association of the cortisol awakening response (CAR) with wake-up cortisol, bedtime cortisol, diurnal slope, and total cortisol area under the curve (AUC). Up to 18 salivary cortisol samples were collected over 3 days from 935 White, Hispanic, and Black individuals (mean age 65 Â± 9.8 years) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Outcome measures included awakening cortisol, CAR (awakening to 30 min post-awakening), early decline (30 min to 2h post-awakening), late decline (2h post-awakening to bedtime), and the corresponding AUCs. Total cortisol AUC was a summary measure of cumulative cortisol exposure. Higher CAR was associated with significantly lower wake-up cortisol (Î²=-0.56; 95% CI: -0.59 to -0.53) and a higher early decline AUC (Î²=0.38; 95% CI: 0.34-0.42) but was not associated with total cortisol AUC (Î²=0.04; 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.09), or other diurnal cortisol curve components following multivariable adjustment. Total cortisol AUC was significantly and positively associated with wake-up cortisol (Î²=0.36; 95% CI: 0.32-0.40), bedtime cortisol (Î²=0.61; 95% CI: 0.58-0.64), and other AUC measures, following multivariable adjustment. Associations were similar by sex, race/ethnicity, and age categories. We conclude that bedtime cortisol showed the strongest correlation with total cortisol AUC, suggesting it may be a marker of daily cortisol exposure.');

Its extent may vary between families and/or between mutation subtypes known to be associated with the disease phenotype. In this article, we posit a Bayesian approach to infer genetic anticipation under flexible random effects models for censored data that capture the effect of successive generations on AOO. Primary interest lies in the random effects. Misspecifying the distribution of random effects may result in incorrect inferential conclusions. We compare the fit of four-candidate random effects distributions via Bayesian model fit diagnostics. A related statistical issue here is isolating the confounding effect of changes in secular trends, screening, and medical practices that may affect time to disease detection across birth cohorts. Using historic cancer registry data, we borrow from relative survival analysis methods to adjust for changes in age-specific incidence across birth cohorts. Our motivating case study comes from a Danish cancer register of 124 families with mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes known to cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, also called Lynch syndrome (LS). We find evidence for a decrease in AOO between generations in this article. Our model predicts family-level anticipation effects that are potentially useful in genetic counseling clinics for high-risk families.');

Comparison of 42 samples examined by both RNA-seq and microarray revealed marked differences in sensitivity, with transcripts identified only by RNA-seq having much lower expression than those also identified by microarray. RNA-seq identified many more differentially expressed transcripts enriched in immune system processes. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed multiple modules of coordinately expressed epidermal differentiation genes, overlapping significantly with genes regulated by the long noncoding RNA TINCR, its target gene, staufen-1 (STAU1), the p63 target gene ZNF750, and its target KLF4. Other coordinately expressed modules were enriched for lymphoid and/or myeloid signature transcripts and genes induced by IL-17 in keratinocytes. Dermally expressed genes were significantly downregulated in psoriatic biopsies, most likely because of expansion of the epidermal compartment. These results show the power of WGCNA to elucidate gene regulatory circuits in psoriasis, and emphasize the influence of tissue architecture in both differential expression and coexpression analysis.');

The study included the analysis of 597 vegetation samples, predominantly grass and weeds, from residential properties selected through a multistage probabilistic sample design in the Midland area, and in Jackson and Calhoun Counties (Michigan), as a background comparison, for 29 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The mean toxic equivalent (TEQ) of the house perimeter vegetation samples ranged from 4.2 to 377 pg/g. The ratio of TEQs (vegetation to soil) was about 0.3, with a maximum of 3.5. Based on a calculation of the similarity of the congener patterns between the soil and the vegetation, it appeared that the source of the contamination on the vegetation was the surrounding soil. This conclusion was supported by linear regression analysis, which showed that the largest contributor to the R(2) for the outcome variable of log(10) of the vegetation concentration was log(10) of the surrounding soil concentration. Models of vegetation contamination usually focus on atmospheric deposition and partitioning. The results obtained here suggest that the deposition of soil particles onto vegetation is a significant route of contamination for residential herbage. Thus, the inclusion of deposition of soil particles onto vegetation is critical to the accurate modeling of contamination residential herbage in communities impacted by historic industrial discharges of persistent organic compounds.');

The DLB group was significantly more impaired than the AD group for verbal fluency, and the AD group was significantly more impaired than the DLB group for verbal delayed recall. The DLB group had greater difficulty than the AD group on a visual discrimination task that does not require motor functioning, but the difference did not reach significance.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(677,16651420,'One of the greatest challenges in developing therapeutic regimens is the inability to rapidly and objectively assess tumor response due to treatment. Moreover, tumor response to therapeutic intervention in many cases is transient, and progressive alterations within the tumor may mask the effectiveness of an initially successful therapy. The ability to detect these changes as they occur would allow timely initiation of alternative approaches, maximizing therapeutic outcome. We investigated the ability of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide a sensitive measure of tumor response throughout the course of treatment, possibly identifying changes in sensitivity to the therapy. Orthotopic 9L gliomas were subjected to two separate therapeutic regimens, with one group receiving a single 5-day cycle (1omega) of low-dose 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and a second group receiving two cycles at the same dose, bisected with 2 days of rest (2omega). Apparent diffusion coefficient maps were acquired before and throughout treatment to observe changes in water mobility, and these observations were correlated to standard measures of therapeutic response and outcome. Our results showed that diffusion MRI was indeed able to detect the emergence of a drug-resistant tumor subpopulation subsequent to an initially successful cycle of BCNU therapy, leading to minimal gains from a second cycle. These diffusion MRI findings were highly correlated with tumor growth delay, animal survival, and ex vivo growth inhibition assays showing emerging resistance in excised tumors. Overall, this study highlights the ability of diffusion MRI to provide sensitive dynamic assessment of therapy-induced response, allowing early opportunities for optimization of therapeutic protocols.');

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(679,20159077,'The Crash Injury Research Engineering Network (CIREN) database contains detailed medical and crash information on a large number of severely injured occupants in motor vehicle crashes. CIREN''s major limitation for stand-alone analyses to explore injury risk factors is that control subjects without a given injury type must have another severe injury to be included in the database. This leads to bias toward the null in the estimation of risk associations. One method to cope with this limitation is to obtain information about occupants without a given injury type from the National Automotive Sampling System''s Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS), which is a probability sample of towaway crashes, containing similar crash information, but less medical detail. Combining CIREN and NASS-CDS in this manner takes advantage of the increased sample size when outcomes are available in both datasets; otherwise NASS-CDS can serve as a sample of controls to be combined with CIREN cases, possibly under a sensitivity analysis that includes and excludes NASS-CDS subjects whose status as a control is uncertain. Because CIREN is not a probability sample of crashes that meet its inclusion criteria, we develop a method to estimate the probability of selection for the CIREN cases using data from NASS-CDS. These estimated probabilities are then used to compute "pseudo-weights" for the CIREN cases. These pseudo-weights not only allow for reduced bias in the estimation of risk associations, they allow direct prevalence estimates to be made using medical outcome data available only in CIREN. We illustrate the use of these methods with both simulation studies and application to estimation of prevalence and predictors of AIS 3+ injury risk to head, thorax, and lower extremity regions, as well as prevalence and predictors of acetabular pelvic fractures. Results of these analyses demonstrate combining NASS and CIREN data can yield improvements in mean square error and nominal confidence interval coverage over analyses that use either the NASS-CDS or the CIREN sample alone.');

We adopt a semiparametric Bayesian framework instead, assuming a Dirichlet process prior with a mixing normal distribution on the distribution of the stratum effects. We also account for possible missingness in the exposure variable in our model. The actual estimation is carried out through a Markov chain Monte Carlo numerical integration scheme.

The gold standard approach is to use gene dropping to simulate null genome scans. Unfortunately, this approach is too computationally expensive for many data sets of interest. An alternative, more efficient method for sampling null genome scans is to pre-calculate pools of family-specific statistics and then resample from these replicate pools to generate "pseudo-replicate" genome scans. In this study, we use simulations to explore properties of the replicate pool p-value estimator pRP and show that it provides an excellent approximation to the traditional gene-dropping estimator for significantly less computational effort. While the computational efficiency of the replicate pool estimator is noticeable in almost all data sets, by applying the replicate pool method to several previously characterized data sets we show that savings in computational effort can be especially significant (on the order of 10,000-fold or more) when one or more large families are analyzed. We also estimate replicate pool p-values for the schizophrenia data described by Abecasis et al. and show that pRP closely approximates gene-drop p-values for all linkage peaks reported for this study. Lastly, we expand upon Song et al.''s previous work by deriving a conservative estimator of the variance for PRP that can easily be computed in practical settings.

The HGPS gene was initially localized to chromosome 1q by observing two cases of uniparental isodisomy of 1q-the inheritance of both copies of this material from one parent-and one case with a 6-megabase paternal interstitial deletion. Sequencing of LMNA, located in this interval and previously implicated in several other heritable disorders, revealed that 18 out of 20 classical cases of HGPS harboured an identical de novo (that is, newly arisen and not inherited) single-base substitution, G608G(GGC > GGT), within exon 11. One additional case was identified with a different substitution within the same codon. Both of these mutations result in activation of a cryptic splice site within exon 11, resulting in production of a protein product that deletes 50 amino acids near the carboxy terminus.

Since relative accuracy estimation has poor small sample properties, adjusted estimators based on adding constants to the observed data have been proposed. The adjusted estimators have the advantage that they yield point and variance estimates of relative accuracy in all settings. However, we show through both theory and numerical examples that adding constants to the data can be beneficial or detrimental to small sample performance. Furthermore, the performance of the adjusted estimator depends not only on the magnitude of the constant but also on parameters that cannot be estimated with data from a screen positive study, making selection of an optimal constant difficult in practice.

Patients undergoing colectomy surgery (n = 4331) were studied. Factors potentially associated with SSI were tested using univariate statistical tests, and a hierarchical generalized linear model was created to test for independent associations between processes of care and SSI, while adjusting for patient risk factors and clustering of patients within hospitals.Several perioperative care practices were independently associated with lower risk of SSI after adjustment for patient risk, procedure type/duration, and clustering of patients by hospital site. Best practices include selection of a Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP-2)-compliant prophylactic intravenous antibiotic, postoperative normothermia, postoperative day 1 glucose control, and oral antibiotics given when bowel prep used (SCIP-1 was not significant).

In other tissues, all carcinomas, regardless of morphological type, are treated as though they represent a single disease. To better understand the biological and clinical features seen in the four major histological types of ovarian carcinoma (OvCa), we analyzed gene expression in 113 ovarian epithelial tumors using oligonucleotide microarrays. Global views of the variation in gene expression were obtained using PCA. These analyses show that mucinous and clear cell OvCas can be readily distinguished from serous OvCas based on their gene expression profiles, regardless of tumor stage and grade. In contrast, endometrioid adenocarcinomas show significant overlap with other histological types. Although high-stage/grade tumors are generally separable from low-stage/grade tumors, clear cell OvCa has a molecular signature that distinguishes it from other poor-prognosis OvCas. Indeed, 73 genes, expressed 2- to 29-fold higher in clear cell OvCas compared with each of the other OvCa types, were identified. Collectively, the data indicate that gene expression patterns in ovarian adenocarcinomas reflect both morphological features and biological behavior. Moreover, these studies provide a foundation for the development of new type-specific diagnostic strategies and treatments for ovarian cancer.');

Of the SNPs associated with T2D in previous GWAS, only variants at CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 showed the strongest association with T2D in the meta-analysis including all three ethnic groups. However, consistent direction of effect was observed for many of the other SNPs in our study and in those carried out in European populations. Close examination of the associations at both the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci provided some evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation to the associations with T2D. We also detected variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations for most of these loci that have been previously identified. These factors, combined with limited statistical power, may contribute to the failure to detect associations across populations of diverse ethnicity. These findings highlight the value of surveying across diverse racial/ethnic groups towards the fine-mapping efforts for the casual variants and also of the search for variants, which may be population-specific.');

Our objectives were to assess urinary continence changes early in the postoperative period and determine which of 2 commonly used definitions of continence more closely relate to patient reported urinary impairment.A prospective study of 90 men with clinically localized prostate cancer who selected radical prostatectomy as primary therapy was conducted. Repeated measures of urinary continence as defined by 1) total urinary control, 2) the use of 1 or 0 pads daily, and 3) small or no problem with urinary function were obtained with a brief survey preoperatively and postoperatively.At 56 days after removal of urethral catheters, the actuarial rates of urinary continence recovery based on definitions 1 to 3 were 43%, 84% and 82%, respectively. The use of definition 2 for continence resulted in a 1.9 times higher actuarial rate for continence recovery when compared to definition 1 at 56 days (p <0.001). However, strong agreement was observed between definitions 2 and 3 (kappa = 0.69).Urinary control is recovered in a significant proportion of men who undergo radical prostatectomy during the initial 3 months.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(712,18336702,'The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Kidney Committee is considering a proposal for a new deceased donor kidney allocation system. Among the components under consideration is a strategy to rank candidates in part by the estimated incremental years of life that are expected to be achieved with a transplant from a specific available deceased donor, computed as the difference in expected median lifespan with that transplant compared with remaining on dialysis. This concept has been termed life years from transplant or LYFT. Median lifespans could be calculated, based on objective medical criteria, for each candidate when a deceased donor kidney becomes available, based on Cox regression models using current candidate and donor medical information. The distribution of the calculated LYFT scores for an average nonexpanded criteria donor kidney is similar across candidate sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status and, with the exception of diabetes, diagnosis. LYFT scores tend to be higher for younger candidates and lower for diabetics receiving a kidney-alone rather than a simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplant. Prioritizing candidates with higher LYFT scores for each available kidney could substantially increase total years of life among both transplant candidates and recipients. LYFT is also a powerful metric for assessing trends in allocation outcomes and for comparing alternative allocation systems.');

This finding has important implications in complex genetic studies, because of the potential existence of unmodeled genetic parameter heterogeneity. The authors further stated the important point that, given unmodeled heterogeneity, the ascertainment-adjusted parameter estimates reflect the true parameter values in the ascertained subpopulation. They illustrated these statements with two examples. By revisiting these examples, we demonstrate that if the ascertainment scheme and the nature of the data can be correctly modeled, then an ascertainment-adjusted analysis returns population-based parameter estimates. We further demonstrate that if the ascertainment scheme and data cannot be modeled properly, then the resulting ascertainment-adjusted analysis produces parameter estimates that generally do not reflect the true values in either the original population or the ascertained subpopulation.');

Total lung emphysema was measured using the density mask technique with a -950 Hounsfield unit threshold. An automated programme measured mean wall thickness (WT), wall area percentage (WA%) and 10 mm lumenal perimeter (pi10) in six segmental bronchi. Separate multivariate analyses examined the relative influence of airway measures and emphysema on SGRQ and BODE.In separate models predicting SGRQ score, a 1 unit SD increase in each airway measure predicted higher SGRQ scores (for WT, 1.90 points higher, p=0.002; for WA%, 1.52 points higher, p=0.02; for pi10, 2.83 points higher p<0.001). The comparable increase in SGRQ for a 1 unit SD increase in emphysema percentage in these models was relatively weaker, significant only in the pi10 model (for emphysema percentage, 1.45 points higher, p=0.01). In separate models predicting BODE, a 1 unit SD increase in each airway measure predicted higher BODE scores (for WT, 1.07-fold increase, p<0.001; for WA%, 1.20-fold increase, p<0.001; for pi10, 1.16-fold increase, p<0.001).

In patients with PPCD, these cells manifest in an epithelial morphology and gene expression pattern, produce an aberrant basement membrane, and, sometimes, spread over the iris and nearby structures in a way that increases the risk for glaucoma. We previously mapped PPCD to a region (PPCD3) on chromosome 10 containing the gene that encodes the two-handed zinc-finger homeodomain transcription factor TCF8. Here, we report a heterozygous frameshift mutation in TCF8 that segregates with PPCD in the family used to map PPCD3 and four different heterozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations in TCF8 in four other PPCD probands. Family reports of inguinal hernia, hydrocele, and possible bone anomalies in affected individuals suggest that individuals with TCF8 mutations should be examined for nonocular anomalies. We detect transcripts of all three identified PPCD genes (VSX1, COL8A2, and TCF8) in the cornea. We show presence of a complex (core plus secondary) binding site for TCF8 in the promoter of Alport syndrome gene COL4A3, which encodes collagen type IV alpha 3, and we present immunohistochemical evidence of ectopic expression of COL4A3 in corneal endothelium of the proband of the original PPCD3 family. Identification of TCF8 as the PPCD3 gene provides a valuable tool for the study of critical gene regulation events in PPCD pathology and suggests a possible role for TCF8 mutations in altered structure and function of cells lining body cavities other than the anterior chamber of the eye. Thus, this study has identified TCF8 as the gene responsible for approximately half of the cases of PPCD, has implicated TCF8 mutations in developmental abnormalities outside the eye, and has presented the TCF8 regulatory target, COL4A3, as a key, shared molecular component of two different diseases, PPCD and Alport syndrome.');

The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) contains a subsample of homosexual men whose date of HIV seroconversion is known within +/-6 months and who provide data for this analysis. From this subsample, we extract two overlapping data subsets. The first subset consists of 370 persons whose 3,723 study visits include complete data on the cellular markers CD4 lymphocyte number and percent for a period of 9 years. The second consists of 272 persons whose 1,593 visits include complete information on cellular markers and on the serological markers beta2-microglobulin and neopterin for a period of 5 1/2 years. We model the residual time to AIDS diagnosis with a regression model, in which cellular and serologic markers are the explanatory covariates (independent variables) and the residual time to AIDS is the responses variable (dependent variable). A robust estimate of the variance-covariance matrix corrects for the dependence of repeated measurements in the same individual. In the case of CD4 number and percent, the results indicate that time since infection is of none or at most little importance if the marker value is known, suggesting that time since infection can be adequately replaced by the combination of marker values.

Female offspring born to untreated control females and prenatal testosterone-treated females were then studied during their first two breeding seasons. Sheep were given two injections of prostaglandin F2alpha 11 days apart, and blood samples were collected at 2-h intervals for 120 h, 10-min intervals for 8 h during the luteal phase (first breeding season only), and daily for an additional 15 days to characterize changes in reproductive hormonal dynamics. During the first breeding season, prenatal testosterone-treated females manifested disruptions in the timing and magnitude of primary gonadotropin surges, luteal defects, and reduced responsiveness to progesterone negative feedback. Disruptions in the periovulatory sequence of events during the second breeding season included: 1) delayed but increased preovulatory estradiol rise, 2) delayed and severely reduced primary gonadotropin surge in prenatal testosterone-treated females having an LH surge, 3) tendency for an amplified secondary FSH surge and a shift in the relative balance of FSH regulatory proteins, and 4) luteal responses that ranged from normal to anovulatory.

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed on clinically localized, untreated primary prostate cancers from 16 AAMs and 16 CAMs. Detailed statistical analysis was used to delineate gains and deletions with high sensitivity and specificity and to compare the frequency and pattern of alterations between the two groups of tumors. The two groups of patients had indistinguishable preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen levels, and the two groups of tumors had similar pathological stages and grades. Chromosomal gains and deletions occurred in regions known to be frequently altered in prostate cancer. Specifically, the most frequent alterations were deletions of regions on chromosomes 13q, 5q, 16q, and 8p and gains of regions on 8q and 5q. When tumors from AAMs and CAMs were compared, the frequencies of alteration (deletion, gain, or no alteration) were similar across 98.9% of the length of the genome. The patterns of alterations of the most frequently altered chromosomes were also similar between tumors from AAMs and CAMs. We concluded that primary prostate cancers from AAMs and CAMs harbor a similar pattern and frequency of chromosomal alterations.

The second test assesses whether the candidate SNP and the disease locus are in complete LD so that the SNP or a marker in complete LD with it may account fully for the linkage signal.

A 5 U increment of the VE/VCO2 slope to peak exercise corresponded to a 9% increase in mortality risk. When tests were grouped by peak exercise intensity, by quartiles of peak respiratory exchange ratio, the VE/VCO2 slope to peak exercise was always a better predictor than peak VO2.Peak and sub-maximal measures of ventilatory efficiency were not equivalent, and the VE/VCO2 slope to peak exercise was the best predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure.

Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (Pâ<â0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20% of heritable variation).

The displacement of dose-response curves to higher doses reflects the growth during radiation treatment of subclinical pelvic deposits which are beyond the future surgical margins.Dose-response curves are steep if the effect of overall duration of radiation therapy is accounted for. The time-related displacement of these steep dose-response curves is consistent with a median doubling time for malignant clonogenic cells of about 4 or 5 days, much faster than the growth rate of the average primary tumor at diagnosis. This rapid growth is evident within the first few days of irradiation, implying that the natural growth rate of these microscopic deposits if fast, and/or that an acceleration of growth follows initiation of radiation injury with a very short lag time.Subclinical pelvic deposits of rectal cancer grow rapidly during preoperative radiation therapy with an adverse influence on the rate of pelvic tumor control from protracting the duration of adjuvant treatment.

Recent studies demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in maize and Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the currently available mixed-model methods suffer from computational inefficiency. In this article, we propose a new method, efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), which corrects for population structure and genetic relatedness in model organism association mapping.

We applied EMMA to in silico whole-genome association mapping of inbred mouse strains involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize data sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies to estimate the statistical power of EMMA under various SNP effects, varying degrees of population structure, and differing numbers of multiple measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of inbred mouse association mapping due to the limited number of available inbred strains, we are able to identify significantly associated SNPs, which fall into known QTL or genes identified through previous studies while avoiding an inflation of false positives.

Following a scale reversal as well, our approach uses Cox regression to model the analyte, with confounder adjustment. The method makes full use of quantifiable analyte measures, while appropriately treating nondetects as censored. Under the proportional hazards assumption, the hazard ratio for a binary health outcome is interpretable as an adjusted odds ratio: the odds for the outcome at any particular analyte concentration divided by the odds given a lower concentration.

The establishment of organ-specific gene expression patterns represents a crucial first step in the clinical application of the molecular approach. Here, we report on the gene expression profiles of 154 primary adenocarcinomas of the lung, colon, and ovary. Using high-density oligonucleotide arrays with 7129 gene probe sets, comprehensive gene expression profiles of 57 lung, 51 colon, and 46 ovary adenocarcinomas were generated and subjected to principle component analysis and to a cross-validated prediction analysis using nearest neighbor classification. These statistical analyses resulted in the classification of 152 of 154 of the adenocarcinomas in an organ-specific manner and identified genes expressed in a putative tissue-specific manner for each tumor type. Furthermore, two tumors were identified, one in the colon group and another in the ovarian group, that did not conform to their respective organ-specific cohorts. Investigation of these outlier tumors by immunohistochemical profiling revealed the ovarian tumor was consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of colonic origin and the colonic tumor was a pleomorphic mesenchymal tumor, probably a leiomyosarcoma, rather than an epithelial tumor. Our results demonstrate the ability of gene expression profiles to classify tumors and suggest that determination of organ-specific gene expression profiles will play a significant role in a wide variety of clinical settings, including molecular diagnosis and classification.');

By using a modification of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), mu and kappa Ig loci were sequenced from nine Id- variants derived directly by anti-Id immunoselection in vivo. Ig kappa loci sequence analysis was also performed from 10 additional variants amplified directly from tumor cells in vitro without immunoselection. We demonstrate that the molecular mechanism underlying tumor cell escape in this model is the spontaneous emergence of variants that have undergone kappa L chain gene "re-rearrangement" before positive selection by the anti-Id antibody. A second round of re-rearrangement was also demonstrated to occur within primary tumor variants. Re-rearrangement of the 38C13 tumor cell Ig kappa locus is strongly biased toward use of variable kappa genes within the conserved V kappa-Ox1 gene family, although their use is not exclusive. With the use of RNA PCR re-rearrangement was documented to occur in vitro at a frequency of approximately 1.0 x 10(-5)/cell.

We quantified over 5,000 peptides and over 22,000 transcripts in livers of 97 inbred and recombinant inbred strains and focused on the 7,185 most heritable transcripts and 486 most reliable proteins. The transcript levels were quantified by microarray analysis in three replicates and the proteins were quantified by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry using O(18)-reference-based isotope labeling approach. We show that the levels of transcripts and proteins correlate significantly for only about half of the genes tested, with an average correlation of 0.27, and the correlations of transcripts and proteins varied depending on the cellular location and biological function of the gene. We examined technical and biological factors that could contribute to the modest correlation. For example, differential splicing clearly affects the analyses for certain genes; but, based on deep sequencing, this does not substantially contribute to the overall estimate of the correlation. We also employed genome-wide association analyses to map loci controlling both transcript and protein levels. Surprisingly, little overlap was observed between the protein- and transcript-mapped loci. We have typed numerous clinically relevant traits among the strains, including adiposity, lipoprotein levels, and tissue parameters. Using correlation analysis, we found that a low number of clinical trait relationships are preserved between the protein and mRNA gene products and that the majority of such relationships are specific to either the protein levels or transcript levels.

One recognizes that there may be useful information in the outputs for grid cells that are neighbors of the one in which the location lies. The second acknowledges potential spatial misalignment between a station and its putatively associated grid cell. The first model is a Gaussian Markov random field smoothed downscaler that relates monitoring station data and computer model output via the introduction of a latent Gaussian Markov random field linked to both sources of data. The second model is a smoothed downscaler with spatially varying random weights defined through a latent Gaussian process and an exponential kernel function, that yields, at each site, a new variable on which the monitoring station data is regressed with a spatial linear model. We applied both methods to daily ozone concentration data for the Eastern US during the summer months of June, July and August 2001, obtaining, respectively, a 5% and a 15% predictive gain in overall predictive mean square error over our earlier downscaler model (Berrocal et al., 2010b).

Clonogenic survival assays were performed in the presence of ionizing radiation with or without CI-1033. For some experiments, clonogen numbers, defined as the product of surviving fraction and total number of cells, were calculated at each time point during a course of multifraction radiation.CI-1033 potently inhibited the growth of ErbB-overexpressing breast cancer cells. A single 48-h exposure of 1 microM CI-1033 resulted in growth inhibition for 7 days, whereas three times weekly administration resulted in sustained growth inhibition. Clonogenic survival was modestly decreased after a 7-day exposure to CI-1033. Exposure to both CI-1033 and radiation (6 Gy) yielded a 23-fold decrease in clonogenic survival compared to radiation alone. In a multifraction experiment, exposure to CI-1033 and three 5-Gy fractions of gamma radiation decreased the total number of clonogens in the population by 65-fold compared to radiation alone.CI-1033 results in potent growth inhibition and modest cytotoxicity of ErbB-overexpressing breast cancer cells, and has synergistic effects when combined with ionizing radiation.

In this paper, we propose a semi-parametric cure model in which covariates can affect both the incidence and the latency. A logistic regression model is proposed for the incidence, and the latency is determined by an accelerated failure time regression model with unspecified error distribution.

Unlicensed driving, defined as not having any type of license and "driving on [one''s] own" as opposed to learning to drive, or not driving yet was ascertained.One (4.2%) in 25 US 9th- through 11th-graders reported that they drove at least 1 hour/week without a license. Unlicensed drivers were more likely to identify as being black or Hispanic, to live in rural or central city districts, and to report lower grades in school. No relationship was found between license status and reported crashes; however, unlicensed teenaged drivers were less likely to report seat belt use, more likely to report driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and more likely to report more trips without a purpose. One fourth (28%) of them had taken a driver''s education class, and one half (50%) reported parents as most helpful in learning to drive. Two thirds (66%) of the unlicensed drivers reported most often using a vehicle that others usually drive.Considering the high burden of teen crashes, it is important to reach and deliver effective anticipatory guidance to unlicensed teenaged drivers who are at high risk for unsafe driving practices. Parents and driver''s education instructors have contact with many of these unlicensed drivers. Clinicians, particularly those in rural and central city districts, should discuss unlicensed driving starting before the legal age of driving while screening for other health risk behaviors.

In the second stage, a model (typically a deconvolution model) is fit to the data conditional on the number of pulses. Any error made in the first stage is carried over to the second stage. Furthermore, current methods, except two, assume that the underlying basal concentration is constant. We present a fully Bayesian deconvolution model that simultaneously estimates the number of secretion episodes, as well as their locations, and a nonconstant basal concentration.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of clinically translating the functional diffusion map (fDM) imaging biomarker for quantifying the spatiotemporal effects of bone tumor response in a patient treated for metastatic PCa with bone metastases. A patient beginning therapy was scanned using MRI before treatment and again at 2 and 8 weeks post-treatment initiation to quantify changes in tumor diffusion values. Three metastatic lesions were identified for fDM analysis, all of which all demonstrated an early increase in diffusion values at 2 weeks, which increased further at 8 weeks post-treatment initiation. This finding correlated with a decrease in the patient''s prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels suggestive of patient response. CT, bone scans, and anatomic MRI images obtained posttreatment were found to be uninformative for the assessment of treatment effectiveness. This study presents the feasibility of fDM-measurements in osseous lesions over time and shows that changes in fDM values were consistent with therapeutic response.

We borrow ideas from the classical two-way analysis of variance literature to address the issue of robust modeling of interactions in repeated-measures studies. While classical interaction models proposed by Tukey and Mandel have interaction structures as a function of main effects, a newer class of models, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) models, do not have similar restrictive assumptions on the interaction structure. AMMI entails a singular value decomposition of the cell residual matrix after fitting the additive main effects and has been shown to perform well across various interaction structures. We consider these models for testing GGI and GEI from two perspectives: likelihood ratio test based on cell means and a regression-based approach using individual observations. Simulation results indicate that both approaches for AMMI models lead to valid tests in terms of maintaining the type I error rate, with the regression approach having better power properties. The performance of these models was evaluated across different interaction structures and 12 common epistasis patterns. In summary, AMMI model is robust with respect to misspecified interaction structure and is a useful screening tool for interaction even in the absence of main effects.

The viral protein p12 previously has been characterized to interfere with major histocompatibility complex class, ICAM-1, and ICAM-2 expression, and it activates STAT5. Using a previously established T-cell line immortalized with an HTLV-1 molecular clone deleted for p12, we assessed the role of p12 in regulating cellular growth and virus transmission. These cells were complemented for p12 expression by the transduction of a lentivirus vector expressing p12. We report that p12 conferred a selective growth advantage in vitro and increased the colony formation of human T cells in soft-agar assays. Consistently with previous studies, p12- and p12+ cell lines produced similar amounts of virus particles released into the supernatant of cultured cells, although we found that p12 expression greatly enhanced virus transmission. Moreover, we found that interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulation also increased HTLV-1 transmission whether p12 was expressed or not, and inversely, that the inhibition of Jak signaling significantly reduced HTLV-1 transmission. Intriguingly, IL-2/Jak signaling was not associated with changes in viral gene expression, viral RNA encapsidation, the maturation of the virus particle, cell-cell adherence, or Gag polarization and virological synapse formation. We do demonstrate, however, that IL-2 stimulation and p12 expression significantly increased the rate of syncytium formation, revealing a novel role for IL-2 signaling and Jak activation in HTLV-1 virus transmission.');

The proliferative activity of a given lesion is commonly valuated by MIB1, a monoclonal antibody to Ki67 proliferation antigen. Immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining expression of bcl-2 and Ki67 was retrospectively investigated in a series of 52 colorectal carcinomas and 56 adenomas according to the avidin-biotin-complex method. The aim of the study was twofold: 1) to investigate any correlation between MIB1 and bcl-2 immunostaining expression in colonic adenomas and carcinomas, 2) to identify any relationship between either marker and several histopathologic parameters including tumor size, pathologic stage, lymph node metastasis, angio-lymphatic invasion, tumor grade and differentiation in colon carcinomas. Bcl-2 was consistently higher in adenomas than in carcinomas. There were 44/56 (78.6%) adenomas, and 27/52 (51.9%) carcinomas positive for bcl-2 (p=0.004).

We hypothesized that some of this unexplained heritability might be due to common and rare variants that reside in GWAS identified loci but lack appropriate proxies in modern genotyping arrays. To assess this hypothesis, we re-examined 7 genes (APOE, APOC1, APOC2, SORT1, LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9) in 5 loci associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in multiple GWAS. For each gene, we first catalogued genetic variation by re-sequencing 256 Sardinian individuals with extreme LDL-C values. Next, we genotyped variants identified by us and by the 1000 Genomes Project (totaling 3,277 SNPs) in 5,524 volunteers. We found that in one locus (PCSK9) the GWAS signal could be explained by a previously described low-frequency variant and that in three loci (PCSK9, APOE, and LDLR) there were additional variants independently associated with LDL-C, including a novel and rare LDLR variant that seems specific to Sardinians. Overall, this more detailed assessment of SNP variation in these loci increased estimates of the heritability of LDL-C accounted for by these genes from 3.1% to 6.5%. All association signals and the heritability estimates were successfully confirmed in a sample of â¼10,000 Finnish and Norwegian individuals. Our results thus suggest that focusing on variants accessible via GWAS can lead to clear underestimates of the trait heritability explained by a set of loci.

In DOPPS I and II, longitudinal data have been collected from both a prevalent (cross-sectional) patient sample and an incident patient sample. Data have also been collected on numerous facility practice patterns. Most DOPPS analyses incorporate both facility- and patient-level data in regression-based analyses to investigate predictors of survival, hospitalization, quality of life, vascular access type, and other outcomes. DOPPS longitudinal data also help identify trends in subject characteristics, practice indicators, medication use, and outcomes.

Exploiting the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis, are independent of non-genetic confounding, and are unmodified by disease processes, mendelian randomisation can be used to test the hypothesis that the association of a plasma biomarker with disease is causal.We performed two mendelian randomisation analyses. First, we used as an instrument a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the endothelial lipase gene (LIPG Asn396Ser) and tested this SNP in 20 studies (20,913 myocardial infarction cases, 95,407 controls). Second, we used as an instrument a genetic score consisting of 14 common SNPs that exclusively associate with HDL cholesterol and tested this score in up to 12,482 cases of myocardial infarction and 41,331 controls. As a positive control, we also tested a genetic score of 13 common SNPs exclusively associated with LDL cholesterol.Carriers of the LIPG 396Ser allele (2Â·6% frequency) had higher HDL cholesterol (0Â·14 mmol/L higher, p=8Ã10(-13)) but similar levels of other lipid and non-lipid risk factors for myocardial infarction compared with non-carriers. This difference in HDL cholesterol is expected to decrease risk of myocardial infarction by 13% (odds ratio [OR] 0Â·87, 95% CI 0Â·84-0Â·91). However, we noted that the 396Ser allele was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0Â·99, 95% CI 0Â·88-1Â·11, p=0Â·85). From observational epidemiology, an increase of 1 SD in HDL cholesterol was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0Â·62, 95% CI 0Â·58-0Â·66). However, a 1 SD increase in HDL cholesterol due to genetic score was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0Â·93, 95% CI 0Â·68-1Â·26, p=0Â·63).

In the National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey, conducted during 1980, health service data were obtained from a national sample of 17,123 civilian noninstitutionalized individuals. These data have been analyzed to define the impact and demographic patterns of health care utilization and costs attributable to adult cardiovascular conditions. Approximately 28 million persons in the United States, or 17.3 percent of the total civilian noninstitutionalized population 17 years of age and over, had a cardiovascular condition during 1980. Cardiovascular conditions were reported with increasing frequency in successively older age groups and were reported most frequently by black persons. The prevalence and economic impact differed by specific type of cardiovascular condition and whether the condition was complicated by another disease. To examine these differences, persons reporting cardiovascular conditions were categorized into four mutually exclusive groups: persons with hypertension alone, persons with arteriosclerotic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease associated with hypertension, persons with arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease alone, and persons with cardiovascular disease associated with other conditions that might alter medical care utilization and disability. The disability, service utilization, and health care charges were compared among these groups, and data for each group were compared with those for the overall U.S. population. Survey participants were asked to rate their health relative to that of other people their age. The self-rating of persons reporting hypertension alone was lower than the national average. Only 17 percent of the general population rated their health as "fair" or "poor," but 27 percent of persons with hypertension alone used these descriptions. Overall, persons with hypertension alone were much less likely to be employed than the general population (52.2 percent versus 71.6 percent). However, when controlling for age, it was found that persons with hypertension alone were about as likely to be employed as the general population. On the average, persons with hypertension reported only slightly more work-loss days than did the general population (6.5 versus 4.9 days). A modest restriction of activity was reported by those with hypertension alone (20.1 days per year on the average compared with 15.6 for the general population).

The aim in this study is to delineate more clearly the relation of activation to future CD4 values and disease progression. By analyzing a cohort of 198 seroconverters from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study with 9 years'' follow-up, the dynamic changes and levels of these three markers and their interrelationships are explored. We observed that the levels of markers in the first year after seroconversion have a much stronger impact on the progression of the disease than the preseroconversion marker levels. The actual change during the year after seroconversion is not as important as the final level reached during that year. The early levels of markers after seroconversion appear to be good indicators of the subsequent course of disease as defined by CD4 level and slightly better than the quantitative changes following seroconversion or the changes in the period 1 to 2.5 years after seroconversion. To investigate the variation between subjects, the 198 seroconverters were stratified into three approximately equal-sized groups in 12 ways based on their pre- and postseroconversion levels and changes in the three markers. The group with the highest CD4 level within a year after seroconversion maintains the highest CD4 level 8 years after seroconversion. The group with the lowest level of neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin in this period has much higher future CD4 counts than the other two groups. The level of markers during the first year after seroconversion has a high predictive power for AIDS onset. Substantial differences in the hazards of AIDS are found between the groups with the highest and lowest CD4 count, neopterin, and beta 2-microglobulin following seroconversion. The three markers are generally correlated throughout the postseroconversion period but can provide distinct information.

Pan and Schaubel (Can J Stat 36:111-127, 2008) recently proposed inference procedures for an inverse selection probability weighted (ISPW) Cox model, applicable when selection probabilities are not treated as fixed but estimated empirically. The proposed weighting procedure requires auxiliary data to estimate the weights and is computationally more intense than unweighted estimation. The ignorability of sample selection process in terms of parameter estimators and predictions is often of interest, from several perspectives: e.g., to determine if weighting makes a significant difference to the analysis at hand, which would in turn address whether the collection of auxiliary data is required in future studies; to evaluate previous studies which did not correct for selection bias. In this article, we propose methods to quantify the degree of bias corrected by the weighting procedure in the partial likelihood and Breslow-Aalen estimators. Asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistics are derived. The finite-sample significance level and power are evaluated through simulation. The proposed methods are then applied to data from a national organ failure registry to evaluate the bias in a post-kidney transplant survival model.');

Because of the risk of disclosure, ages of very old respondents can often not be released; in particular, this is a specific stipulation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for the release of health data for individuals. Top-coding of individuals beyond a certain age is a standard way of dealing with this issue, and it may be adequate for cross-sectional data, when a modest number of cases are affected. However, this approach leads to serious loss of information in longitudinal studies when individuals have been followed for many years.

The CI of grades II-IV acute GVHD was 35% with tacrolimus and 23% with the combination (P=0.19). The CI of III-IV GVHD was 22% for tacrolimus and 19% for the combination. CI of chronic GVHD was similar between the two groups (P=0.5). Patients with good-risk disease had superior overall survival (OS) when compared to those with poor-risk features (P<0.001).

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate imaging parameters as a function of patient survival at 1 year. Both log-rank and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to assess overall survival.Greater increases in diffusion in response to therapy over time were observed in those patients alive at 1 year compared with those who died as a result of disease. The volume of tumor with increased diffusion by fDM at 3 weeks was the strongest predictor of patient survival at 1 year, with larger fDM predicting longer median survival (52.6 v 10.9 months; log-rank, P < .003; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.9). Radiologic response at 10 weeks had similar prognostic value (median survival, 31.6 v 10.9 months; log-rank P < .0007; HR = 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7 to 7.2). Radiologic response and fDM differed in 25% of cases. A composite index of response including fDM and RR provided a robust predictor of patient survival and may identify patients in whom RR does not correlate with clinical outcome.Compared with conventional neuroimaging, fDM provided an earlier assessment of equal predictive value, and the combination of fDM and RR provided a more accurate prediction of patient survival than either metric alone.');

Specific polypeptides were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. For the same 85 samples, mRNA levels were determined using oligonucleotide microarrays, allowing a comparative analysis of mRNA and protein expression among the 165 protein spots. Twenty-eight of the 165 protein spots (17%) or 21 of 98 genes (21.4%) had a statistically significant correlation between protein and mRNA expression (r > 0.2445; p < 0.05); however, among all 165 proteins the correlation coefficient values (r) ranged from -0.467 to 0.442. Correlation coefficient values were not related to protein abundance. Further, no significant correlation between mRNA and protein expression was found (r = -0.025) if the average levels of mRNA or protein among all samples were applied across the 165 protein spots (98 genes). The mRNA/protein correlation coefficient also varied among proteins with multiple isoforms, indicating potentially separate isoform-specific mechanisms for the regulation of protein abundance. Among the 21 genes with a significant correlation between mRNA and protein, five genes differed significantly between stage I and stage III lung adenocarcinomas.

It is well appreciated that population substructure can result in spurious genetic associations. To understand the ethnic composition of the North American CF population, and to assess the need for population structure adjustment in genetic association studies with North American CF patients, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms on 3076 unrelated North American CF patients were used to perform population structure analyses. We compared self-reported ethnicity to genotype-inferred ancestry, and also examined whether geographic distribution and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutation type could explain the population structure observed. Although largely Caucasian, our analyses identified a considerable number of CF patients with admixed African-Caucasian, Mexican-Caucasian and Indian-Caucasian ancestries. Population substructure was present and comparable across the three studies of the consortium. Neither geographic distribution nor CFTR mutation type explained the population structure. Given the ethnic diversity of the North American CF population, it is essential to carefully detect, estimate and adjust for population substructure to guard against potential spurious findings in CF genetic association studies.

Dental professionals were recruited during the 2010 Michigan Dental Association Annual Convention. Mercury levels in hair and urine samples were analyzed as biomarkers of methylmercury and elemental mercury exposure, respectively.

Distribution of mercury in hair (mean, range: 0.45, 0.02-5.18 Î¼g/g) and urine (0.94, 0.03-5.54 Î¼g/L) correspond well with the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Linear regression models revealed significant associations between diastolic blood pressure (adjusted for blood pressure medication use) and hair mercury (n=262, p=0.02). Urine mercury results opposed hair mercury in many ways. Notably, elemental mercury exposure was associated with a significant systolic blood pressure decrease (n=262, p=0.04) that was driven by the male population. Associations between blood pressure and two forms of mercury were found at exposure levels relevant to the general population, and associations varied according to type of mercury exposure and gender.');

For each of the five genes, we selected 1) nonredundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (r(2)< 0.8 with other SNPs) from the HapMap database or another linkage disequilibrium map, 2) SNPs with previously reported type 2 diabetes association, and 3) nonsynonymous coding SNPs.

We followed up 35 of the most significant SNPs by genotyping them on another 384 case subjects and 366 control subjects from Finland. We also supplemented our previous HNF4A results by genotyping 12 SNPs on additional Finnish samples. After correcting for testing multiple correlated SNPs within a gene, we find evidence of type 2 diabetes association with SNPs in five of the six known MODY genes: GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, NEUROD1, and HNF4A.

Ninety-six phage clones were sequenced for identification, and 21 clones were validated using Luminex. One of these proteins, L23, a novel tumor antigen in SCCHN, was validated as an oncogene. L23 is upregulated in SCCHN compared with normal keratinocytes. Knockdown of L23 inhibited proliferation, invasion and cell survival. Overexpression of L23 had the reverse effect. Overexpression of L23 in non malignant cells led to transformation. Injection of SCCHN cells with knockdown of L23 in mice, induced tumors that were significantly smaller than control tumors.

Limitations of this approach include the difficulty to verify the correctness of the specified functional form and the fact that, in the presence of a treatment effect that varies over time, investigators are usually interested in the cumulative as opposed to instantaneous treatment effect. In many applications, censoring time is not independent of event time. Therefore, we propose methods for estimating the cumulative treatment effect in the presence of nonproportional hazards and dependent censoring.

Reduced CDX2 expression was associated with tumor location (right sided), poor differentiation, high microsatellite instability status, and a positive first-degree family history. We conclude that it is unlikely that common CDX2 variants account for a measurable fraction of susceptibility to colorectal cancer in this population. However, CDX2 expression levels were strongly associated with microsatellite instability and tumor location in the gastrointestinal tract, consistent with a possible role in the specification of gastrointestinal epithelial cell fate in humans.');

Serum PIIINP and C1TP levels were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. PWV was obtained by applanation tonometry from carotid and femoral pressure wave contours. LVMI was measured by echocardiography. Statistical analyses included Pearson''s correlations and multiple linear regression.Both PIIINP and C1TP values were significantly higher in more advanced stages of CKD (P < 0.05). A positive correlation was demonstrated between PWV and LVMI (r = 0.25, P = 0.0018), persisting after adjustment for potential confounders (partial r = 0.27, P = 0.0009). PIIINP correlated with PWV (r = 0.16, p = 0.029) and LVMI (r = 0.16, P = 0.0018), while C1TP correlated with LVMI (r = 0.18, P = 0.013) but not with PWV (r = 0.12, P = 0.09).

The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether a group of perioperative care measures previously shown to be associated with reduced SSI would have an additive effect in SSI reduction. If so, this would support the use of an "SSI prevention bundle" as a quality improvement intervention.Data from 24 hospitals participating in the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative were included in the study. The main outcome measure was SSI. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to account for clustering of patients within hospitals.In total, 4,085 operations fulfilled inclusion criteria for the study (Current Procedural Terminology codes 44140, 44160, 44204, and 44205). A "bundle score" was assigned to each operation, based on the number of perioperative care measures followed (appropriate Surgical Care Improvement Project-2 antibiotics, postoperative normothermia, oral antibiotics with bowel preparation, perioperative glycemic control, minimally invasive surgery, and short operative duration). There was a strong stepwise inverse association between bundle score and incidence of SSI. Patients who received all 6 bundle elements had risk-adjusted SSI rates of 2.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-0.5%), whereas patients who received only 1 bundle measure had SSI rates of 17.5% (95% CI, 27.1-10.8%).This multi-institutional study shows that patients who received all 6 perioperative care measures attained a very low, risk-adjusted SSI rate of 2.0%.

Antibiotic administration is arguably one of the most important modifiable determinants of the composition of the human microbiota. However, quantitatively modeling antibiotic use to account for its impact on microbial community dynamics presents a challenge. We used antibiotic therapy of chronic lung infection in persons with cystic fibrosis as a model system to assess the influence of key variables of therapy on measures of microbial community perturbation. We constructed multivariate linear mixed models with bacterial community diversity as the outcome measure and various scales of antibiotic weighting as predictors, while controlling for other variables. Antibiotic weighting consisted of three components: (i) dosing duration; (ii) timing of administration relative to sample collection; and (iii) antibiotic type and route of administration. Antibiotic weighting based on total dose and proximity to the time of sampling was most predictive of bacterial community change. Using this model to control for antibiotic use enabled the identification of other significant independent predictors of microbial community diversity such as dominant taxon, disease stage, and gender.

In order to examine the requirements for FV in murine embryogenesis and hemostasis, we generated transgenic mouse lines expressing a Fv minigene under control of either the tissue-specific albumin (Malb) or rat platelet factor 4 (Rpf4) promoter. A total of 12 Malb and 3 Rpf4 lines were analyzed. Though expression in the target tissue was detectable in most lines by RT-PCR, only low levels of transgene expression were achieved (<3% of endogenous Fv in all lines). Despite a low level of Fv transgene expression, rescue of the lethal Fv-/- phenotype was observed with one of the Malb transgenic (Tg+) lines. However, rescue appeared to be incomplete with continued loss of >1/2 of expected Tg+,Fv-/- mice in early embryogenesis. Rescued Tg+,Fv-/- mice have undetectable FV (<0.1%) in both plasma and platelet compartments, but survive the perinatal period and mature to adulthood without spontaneous hemorrhage. We conclude that FV present at <0.1% is sufficient to support postnatal survival. Failure of the Malb transgene to rescue the midembryonic block suggests that FV expression is required during mammalian development at higher levels or with a different tissue-specific or temporal pattern. Taken together, these data may explain the observation of residual FV activity in most human FV-deficient patients due to early embryonic lethality in those absolutely deficient, and suggest that minimal levels of FV expression, below the level of detection, also may be sufficient to support survival in humans.');

For a family based study, 166 case-trios (case and both parents) and 83 control-trios (control and both parents) were also genotyped.In the case-control study, carriers of the Z-2 allele of the 5''ALR2 polymorphism had a significantly higher risk of DN than non-carriers (odds ratios: 1.6 for heterozygotes and 2.1 for homozygotes, P<0.05 for each). The same was true for carriers of the T allele of the C-106T polymorphism (odds ratios: 1.6 for heterozygotes and 1.9 for homozygotes, P<0.05 for each). Moreover, the haplotype carrying both risk alleles was in excess in DN cases. In the family study, transmission of risk alleles from heterozygous parents was consistent with the case-control study, excess transmission in case-trios and deficient in control-trios.Association between DN and two DNA sequence variants in the promoter region of the AR gene implicates the polyol pathway in the development of kidney complications in Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Further examination of the molecular mechanisms underlying these findings may provide insight into the pathogenesis of DN.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(900,23788246,'In genome-wide association studies of binary traits, investigators typically use logistic regression to test common variants for disease association within studies, and combine association results across studies using meta-analysis. For common variants, logistic regression tests are well calibrated, and meta-analysis of study-specific association results is only slightly less powerful than joint analysis of the combined individual-level data. In recent sequencing and dense chip based association studies, investigators increasingly test low-frequency variants for disease association. In this paper, we seek to (1) identify the association test with maximal power among tests with well controlled type I error rate and (2) compare the relative power of joint and meta-analysis tests. We use analytic calculation and simulation to compare the empirical type I error rate and power of four logistic regression based tests: Wald, score, likelihood ratio, and Firth bias-corrected. We demonstrate for low-count variants (roughly minor allele count [MAC] < 400) that: (1) for joint analysis, the Firth test has the best combination of type I error and power; (2) for meta-analysis of balanced studies (equal numbers of cases and controls), the score test is best, but is less powerful than Firth test based joint analysis; and (3) for meta-analysis of sufficiently unbalanced studies, all four tests can be anti-conservative, particularly the score test. We also establish MAC as the key parameter determining test calibration for joint and meta-analysis.');

We previously described a strategy for selecting pedigrees for linkage analysis of a quantitative trait on the basis of a pedigree likelihood-ratio statistic. For quantitative traits controlled by a major locus with a rare dominant allele, the likelihood-ratio strategy extracted nearly all the information for linkage while typically requiring marker data on only about one-third of the pedigrees.

Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure above 140 mm Hg, diastolic pressure above 90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medications. Neighborhood (census tract) conditions potentially related to hypertension (walking environment, availability of healthy foods, safety, social cohesion) were measured using information from a separate phone survey conducted in the study neighborhoods. For each neighborhood we estimated scale scores by aggregating residents'' responses using simple aggregation (crude means) and empirical Bayes estimation (unconditional, conditional, and spatial). These estimates of neighborhood conditions were linked to each study participant based on the census tract of residence. Two-level binomial regression methods were used to estimate adjusted associations between neighborhood conditions and hypertension.: Residents of neighborhoods with better walkability, availability of healthy foods, greater safety, and more social cohesion were less likely to be hypertensive (relative prevalence [95% confidence interval] for 90th vs. 10th percentile of conditional empirical Bayes estimate = 0.75 [0.64-0.88], 0.72 [0.61-0.85], 0.74 [0.63-0.86], and 0.69 [0.57-0.83]), respectively, after adjusting for site, age, sex, income, and education.

The orbicularis oculi improved smile attractiveness (P <0.04), especially among smiles rated less favorably (P <0.05). Visibility of the models'' eyes, however, did not influence the ratings (P >0.05), perhaps because orbicularis oculi activation altered activations in other muscles in such a way that smile attractiveness was increased in the lower face.Smile esthetics increased with increased recruitment of muscles involved in smile production.

Texture analysis of the breast tissue surrounding microcalcifications on digitally acquired images during stereotactic biopsy is used in this study to predict malignant vs benign outcomes. 54 biopsy proven cases (36 benign, 18 malignant) are used. The texture analysis calculates statistical features from gray level co-occurrence matrices and fractal geometry for equal probability and linear quantizations of the image data. Discriminant models are generated using linear discriminant analysis and logistic discriminant analysis. Results do not differ significantly by method of quantization or discriminant analysis. Jackknife results misclassify 2 of 18 malignant cases (sensitivity 89%) and 6 of 36 benign cases (specificity 83%) for logistic discriminant analysis. From this preliminary study, texture analysis appears to show significant discriminatory power between benign and malignant tissue, which may be useful in resolving problems of discordance between pathological and mammographic findings, and may ultimately reduce the number of benign biopsies.');

By considering gene expression data within this framework, we found only a small number of genes were required to achieve a relatively high accuracy level in tumor classification. Using as few as 45 genes we were able to classify 157 of 190 human malignant tumors correctly, which is comparable to previous results obtained with sophisticated classifiers using thousands of genes. Our simple classifier accurately predicted the origin of metastatic tumors even when the classifier was trained using only primary tumors, and the classifier produced accurate predictions when trained and tested on expression data from different labs, and from different microarray platforms. Our findings suggest that accurate and robust cancer diagnosis from gene expression profiles can be achieved by mimicking the classification strategies routinely used by surgical pathologists.');

By analysing 731,213 autosomal or X chromosome SNPs and an additional â¼1.9 million imputed variants in 4,694 individuals, we identified several SNPs associated with the selected quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and replicated all the top signals in an independent sample of 1,392 individuals from the same population. Next, to increase power to detect and resolve associations, we further genotyped the whole cohort (6,145 individuals) for 293,875 variants included on the ImmunoChip and MetaboChip custom arrays. Overall, our combined approach led to the identification of 9 genome-wide significant novel independent signals-5 of which were identified only with the custom arrays-and provided confirmatory evidence for an additional 7.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between HMO marketing strategies and selection bias in TEFRA At-Risk HMOs. A purposive sample of 22 HMOs that were actively marketing their TEFRA programs was selected and data on organizational characteristics, market area characteristics, and HMO marketing decisions were collected. To measure selection bias in these HMOs, the functional health status of approximately 300 enrollees in each HMO was compared to that of 300 non-enrolling beneficiaries in the same area. Three dependent variables, reflecting selection bias at the mean, the low health tail, and the high health tail of the health status distribution were created. Weighted least squares regressions were then used to identify relationships between marketing elements and selection bias. Subject to the statistical limitations of the study, our conclusion is that it is doubtful that HMO marketing decisions are responsible for the prevalence of favorable selection in HMO enrollment. It also appears unlikely that HMOs were differentially targeting healthy and unhealthy segments of the Medicare market.');

Alteration of the normal controls of cell proliferation is also a significant factor in the multistep process of tumorigenesis. The proliferative activity of a given lesion is commonly evaluated by MIB 1, a monoclonal antibody to Ki67 proliferation antigen. Mutation of the p53 gene is considered the most common genetic aberration in colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining expression of bcl-2, Ki67, and p53 was retrospectively investigated in a series of 52 colorectal carcinomas and 56 adenomas. The aim of the study was twofold: (i) to investigate any correlation between MIB 1, p53, and bcl-2 immunostaining expression in colonic adenomas and carcinomas and (ii) to identify any relation between these markers and several histopathologic parameters including tumor size, pathologic stage, lymph node metastasis, angiolymphatic invasion, tumor grade, and differentiation in colon carcinomas. bcl-2 was consistently higher in adenomas than in carcinomas. There were 44 of 56 (78.6%) adenomas and 27 of 52 (51.9%) carcinomas positive for bcl-2 (P = 0.004). The mean Ki67 labeling index (LI) was 30.05 +/- 7.6 and 38.12 +/- 11.01 in adenomas and carcinomas, respectively (P = 0.0001). p53 was significantly higher in carcinomas (35 of 52 [67.3%]) than in adenomas (18 of 56 [32.1%]) (P = 0.0004).

We conclude that, in contrast to p53 and Ki67, bcl-2 oncoprotein expression is probably an early step in the process of colon carcinogenesis, and its expression may be associated with favorable pathologic parameters. Furthermore, an inverse relation exists between p53 and Ki67, and bcl-2 IHC expression in colonic neoplasia.

One approach to increasing the power of these studies is to enrich the case sample for individuals likely to be affected because of genetic factors. In this article, we compare three case-selection strategies that use allele-sharing information with the standard strategy that selects a single individual from each family at random. In affected sibship samples, we show that, by carefully selecting sibships and/or individuals on the basis of allele sharing, we can increase the frequency of disease-associated alleles in the case sample. When these cases are compared with unrelated controls, the difference in the frequency of the disease-associated allele is therefore also increased. We find that, by choosing the affected sib who shows the most evidence for pairwise allele sharing with the other affected sibs in families, the test statistic is increased by >20%, on average, for additive models with modest genotype relative risks. In addition, we find that the per-genotype information associated with the allele sharing-based strategies is increased compared with that associated with random selection of a sib for genotyping. Even though we select sibs on the basis of a nonparametric statistic, the additional gain for selection based on the unknown underlying mode of inheritance is minimal. We show that these properties hold even when the power to detect linkage to a region in the entire sample is negligible. This approach can be extended to more-general pedigree structures and quantitative traits.');

Although such tests do not exclude common variants from their evaluation, they focus mostly on testing the effect of rare variants by upweighting rare-variant effects and downweighting common-variant effects and can therefore lose substantial power when both rare and common genetic variants in a region influence trait susceptibility.

Cox regression was used to model the risk of death or graft loss, based on donor and transplant factors, adjusting for recipient factors. The proposed KDRI includes 14 donor and transplant factors, each found to be independently associated with graft failure or death: donor age, race, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, serum creatinine, cerebrovascular cause of death, height, weight, donation after cardiac death, hepatitis C virus status, human leukocyte antigen-B and DR mismatch, cold ischemia time, and double or en bloc transplant. The KDRI reflects the rate of graft failure relative to that of a healthy 40-year-old donor.Transplants of kidneys in the highest KDRI quintile (>1.45) had an adjusted 5-year graft survival of 63%, compared with 82% and 79% in the two lowest KDRI quintiles (<0.79 and 0.79-<0.96, respectively).

Our study assessed the effectiveness of the parametric response map (PRM) imaging biomarker to provide for an earlier measure of patient survival prediction.Forty-five high-grade glioma patients received concurrent chemoradiation. Quantitative MRI including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps were acquired pretreatment and 3 weeks midtreatment on a prospective institutional-approved study. PRM, a voxel-by-voxel image analysis method, was evaluated as an early prognostic biomarker of overall survival. Clinical and conventional MR parameters were also evaluated.Multivariate analysis showed that PRM(ADC+) in combination with PRM(rCBV-) obtained at week 3 had a stronger correlation to 1-year and overall survival rates than any baseline clinical or treatment response imaging metric. The composite biomarker identified three distinct patient groups, nonresponders [median survival (MS) of 5.5 months, 95% CI: 4.4-6.6 months], partial responders (MS of 16 months, 95% CI: 8.6-23.4 months), and responders (MS has not yet been reached).Inclusion of PRM(ADC+) and PRM(rCBV-) into a single imaging biomarker metric provided early identification of patients resistant to standard chemoradiation. In comparison to the current standard of assessment of response at 10 weeks (Macdonald criteria), the composite PRM biomarker potentially provides a useful opportunity for clinicians to identify patients who may benefit from alternative treatment strategies.');

The objective of this study is to describe the effect of PVT on the survival benefit of liver transplantation. Using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data on adult liver transplant candidates wait-listed between September 2001 and December 2007, Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to estimate the covariate-adjusted effect of PVT on transplant rate, waiting list survival, and posttransplant survival. We then used sequential stratification to estimate liver transplant survival benefit by cross-classifications defined by Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and PVT status. The prevalence of reported PVT among 22,291 liver transplant recipients was 4.02% (N = 897). PVT was not a predictor of waiting list mortality (hazard ratio = 0.90, P = 0.23) but was a predictor of posttransplant mortality (hazard ratio = 1.32, P = 0.02). Overall, transplant benefit was not significantly different for patients with PVT versus without PVT (P = 0.21), but there was a shift in the benefit curve. Specifically, the threshold for transplant benefit among patients without PVT was MELD score >11 compared to MELD score >13 for patients with PVT. PVT is associated with significantly higher posttransplant mortality but does not affect waiting list mortality. Among patients with low MELD score, PVT is associated with less transplant survival benefit. Clinicians should carefully consider the risks of liver transplantation in clinically stable patients who have PVT.');

These SNPs defined eight major haplogroups and subdivided groups H and U, which are common in Finns. We evaluated association with both diabetes disease status and up to 14 diabetes-related traits for 762 cases, 402 non-diabetic controls, and 465 offspring of genotyped females.

The literature in support of testing AAM at an earlier age than WM is sparse. Therefore, the authors present clinical and histologic data that support the testing of AAM at a younger age, utilizing data on patients with clinically localized PCa.Examination of consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens from AAM and WM was performed from January 1991 to June 1996 among AAM and WM at Wayne State University, Harper Hospital, Detroit, Michigan. International, salvage prostatectomy, and neoadjuvant hormonal therapy patients were excluded, as were patients with lymph node metastasis. The authors examined biochemical recurrences of PCa in this cohort of men treated from January 1991 through December 1995. Univariate analysis of contingency tables was performed, using chi-squared-tests to assess the correlation between stage and race after stratification of patients by age group. Biochemical recurrence was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test.The authors examined radical prostatectomy specimens from 759 patients and biochemical recurrence outcome of 655 patients. AAM patients ages 50-69 years had higher prostate specific antigen levels, worse Gleason scores, more advanced stages of disease, and a higher recurrence rate. However, among men ages 70-79 years, there was no difference in these parameters between AAM and WM. Among men ages 40-49 years, a larger sample size is necessary to make meaningful comparisons.Data on the outcomes of men treated for clinically localized PCa demonstrated more advanced disease and more frequent recurrence among young AAM than among WM, young and of advanced age. These differences in disease severity and recurrence, in addition to the disproportionate mortality among young AAM, are strong evidence that AAM should be tested for PCa at an earlier age than WM.');

Patients were classified as having decreasing, stable, increasing, or missing mBODE based on their absolute change from baseline. The predictive ability of mBODE change on survival was assessed using multivariate Cox regression models. The index of concordance was used to directly compare the predictive ability of mBODE and its separate components.The entire cohort (610 treated medically and 608 treated surgically) was characterized by severe airflow obstruction, moderate breathlessness, and increased mBODE at baseline. A wide distribution of change in mBODE was seen at follow-up. An increase in mBODE of more than 1 point was associated with increased mortality in surgically and medically treated patients. Surgically treated patients were less likely to experience death or an increase greater than 1 in mBODE.

Models were run to evaluate whether the relation between rates of FFLs and rates of gun homicide varied over the study period and across counties according to their level of urbanism (defined by four groupings, as below). Also, rates of FFLs were compared against FS/S - which is the proportion of suicides committed by firearm and is thought to be a good proxy for firearm availability in a region - to help evaluate how well the FFL variable is serving as a way to proxy firearm availability in each of the county types of interest.In major cities, gun homicide rates were higher where FFLs were more prevalent (rate ratio [RR] = 1.70, 95% CI 1.03-2.81). This association increased (p < 0.01) from 1993 (RR = 1.69) to 1999 (RR = 12.72), due likely to federal reforms that eliminated low-volume dealers, making FFL prevalence a more accurate exposure measure over time. No association was found in small towns. In other cities and in suburbs, gun homicide rates were significantly lower where FFLs were more prevalent, with associations that did not change over the years of the study period. FFL prevalence was correlated strongly (positively) with FS/S in major cities only, suggesting that the findings for how FFL prevalence relates to gun homicide may be valid for the findings pertaining to major cities but not to counties of other types.Modification of FFLs through federal, state, and local regulation may be a feasible intervention to reduce gun homicide in major cities.');

However, understanding the biology of organismal phenotypes will involve understanding regulation in multiple tissues, and ongoing studies are collecting eQTL data in dozens of cell types. Here we present a statistical framework for powerfully detecting eQTLs in multiple tissues or cell types (or, more generally, multiple subgroups). The framework explicitly models the potential for each eQTL to be active in some tissues and inactive in others. By modeling the sharing of active eQTLs among tissues, this framework increases power to detect eQTLs that are present in more than one tissue compared with "tissue-by-tissue" analyses that examine each tissue separately. Conversely, by modeling the inactivity of eQTLs in some tissues, the framework allows the proportion of eQTLs shared across different tissues to be formally estimated as parameters of a model, addressing the difficulties of accounting for incomplete power when comparing overlaps of eQTLs identified by tissue-by-tissue analyses. Applying our framework to re-analyze data from transformed B cells, T cells, and fibroblasts, we find that it substantially increases power compared with tissue-by-tissue analysis, identifying 63% more genes with eQTLs (at FDRâ=â0.05). Further, the results suggest that, in contrast to previous analyses of the same data, the majority of eQTLs detectable in these data are shared among all three tissues.');

Respondents in the lowest tertile of cynical hostility experienced a 22% sharper decline in salivary cortisol (age- and sex-adjusted slope of -0.49 microg/dL per hour) than respondents in the highest tertile (-0.40 microg/dL per hour, p for difference = .0004). Intertertile differences in these parameters remained unaltered after further adjustment for potential confounders.

The ratio of G-to-T k-ras transversion mutation (codon 12) relative to wild-type was significantly higher in tumors from the high-pollution region (0.90) than tumors from the non-pollution site (0.28) (P = 0.03). Relative to tumors with wild-type, the ratio of p53 mutations in exons 5, 7 or 8 to wild-type in tumors from the high-pollution region was significantly higher than the ratio from the non-pollution site (0.28 versus 0.03, P = 0.01). Logistic regression showed that G-to-T transversion mutation in K-ras was predicted by the region of residence of the patients.Our study reveals that there are differences in the frequencies and types of K-ras and p53 mutations found in pancreatic adenocarcinomas of patients in high-pollution and low-pollution regions in Egypt and suggests that environmental factors may explain these differences.

The PROMIS pediatric measures were constructed to be publically available, efficient, precise, and valid across a variety of diseases to assess patient reports of symptoms and quality of life. This study was designed to evaluate the ability of children and adolescents with NS to complete the PROMIS assessment via computer and to initiate validity assessments of the short forms and full item banks in pediatric NS. Successful measurement of patient reported outcomes will contribute to our understanding of the impact of NS on children and adolescents.This cross-sectional study included 151 children and adolescents 8-17 years old with NS from 16 participating institutions in North America. The children completed the PROMIS pediatric depression, anxiety, social-peer relationships, pain interference, fatigue, mobility and upper extremity functioning measures using a web-based interface. Responses were compared between patients experiencing active NS (n = 53) defined by the presence of edema and patients with inactive NS (n = 96) defined by the absence of edema.All 151 children and adolescents were successfully able to complete the PROMIS assessment via computer. As hypothesized, the children and adolescents with active NS were significantly different on 4 self-reported measures (anxiety, pain interference, fatigue, and mobility). Depression, peer relationships, and upper extremity functioning were not different between children with active vs. inactive NS. Multivariate analysis showed that the PROMIS instruments remained sensitive to NS disease activity after adjusting for demographic characteristics.Children and adolescents with NS were able to successfully complete the PROMIS instrument using a web-based interface. The computer based pediatric PROMIS measurement effectively discriminated between children and adolescents with active and inactive NS.

Other strategies such as simply splicing together the intervals before and after the gap potentially lead to bias. A relatively simple imputation approach is developed that bases the number and times of events within the gap on matches to completely recorded histories. Multiple imputation is used to propagate imputation uncertainty. The procedure is developed here for menstrual calendar data, where the recurrent events are menstrual bleeds recorded longitudinally over time. The recording is somewhat onerous, leading to gaps in the calendar data.

In this study, a retrospective cohort of 760 adult patients with chronic liver disease placed on the liver transplant waitlist between January 1995 and March 2001 and followed up for up to 74 months was studied to assess the ability of the MELD to predict mortality among waitlisted candidates and evaluate the prognostic importance of changes in MELD score over time. Serial MELD scores predicted waitlist mortality significantly better than baseline MELD scores or medical urgency status. Each unit of the 40-point MELD score was associated with a 22% increased risk for waitlist death (P <.001), whereas medical urgency status was not a significant independent predictor. For any given MELD score, the magnitude and direction of change in MELD score during the previous 30 days (DeltaMELD) was a significant independent mortality predictor. Patients with MELD score increases greater than 5 points over 30 days had a threefold greater waitlist mortality risk than those for whom MELD scores increased more gradually (P <.0001). We conclude that mortality risk on the liver transplant waitlist is predicted more accurately by serial MELD score determinations than by medical urgency status or single MELD measurements. DeltaMELD score over time reflects progression of liver disease and conveys important additional prognostic information that should be considered in the further evolution of national liver allocation policy.');

Until recently, whether a similar effect of long-chain n-3 PUFAs from seafood occurred in humans was unknown. We summarize the findings from a population-based case-control study that showed that the dietary intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs from seafood, measured both directly with a questionnaire and indirectly with a biomarker, is associated with a reduced risk of primary cardiac arrest in humans. The findings also suggest that 1) compared with no seafood intake, modest dietary intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs from seafood (equivalent to 1 fatty fish meal/wk) is associated with a reduction in the risk of primary cardiac arrest; 2) compared with modest intake, higher intakes of these fatty acids are not associated with a further reduction in such risk; and 3) the reduced risk of primary cardiac arrest may be mediated, at least in part, by the effect of dietary n-3 PUFA intake on cell membrane fatty acid composition. These findings also may help to explain the apparent inconsistencies in earlier studies of long-chain n-3 PUFA intake and ischemic heart disease.');

Models that were composed of different combinations of comorbid conditions and case-mix factors were compared for explained variance (R(2)) and discrimination (c statistic).Seventeen comorbid conditions account for 96% of the total explained variance that would result if 45 comorbidities that were expected to be predictive of survival were added to a demographics-adjusted survival model. These conditions together had more discriminatory power (c statistic 0.67) than age alone (0.63) or serum albumin (0.60) and were equivalent to a combination of routine laboratory and clinical parameters (0.67). The strength of association of the individual comorbidities lessened when laboratory/clinical parameters were added, but all remained significant. The total R(2) of a model adjusted for demographics and laboratory/clinical parameters increased from 0.13 to 0.17 upon addition of comorbidity.A relatively small list of comorbid conditions provides equivalent discrimination and explained variance for survival as a more extensive characterization of comorbidity.

These results provide explicit sample-size guidelines for future positional cloning studies of Mendelian diseases and make possible a more objective evaluation of whether a proposed positional cloning study is likely to be successful.

We have investigated the frequency of this polymorphism in a large case-control study and found no association of the T allele with diabetic nephropathy.

We assessed the mutational status of MRE11 in a panel of 17 CRC cell lines and 46 primary tumors and found a strong correlation with MSI status in both cell lines and tumors. Therefore, we hypothesized that deficiency in MRE11 may sensitize CRC cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) inhibition based on the concept of synthetic lethality. We further assessed the activity of the PARP-1 inhibitor, ABT-888, in CRC cell lines and observed preferential cytotoxicity in those MSI cell lines harboring mutations in MRE11 compared with both wild-type cell lines and microsatellite stable (MSS) cell lines. A significant correlation between MRE11 expression levels and cytotoxicity to ABT-888 at 10 Î¼M was observed (RÂ² = 0.915, P < 0.001). Using two experimental approaches, including short hairpin RNA knocking down MRE11 in the wild-type and MSS cell line SW-480 and a second cell line model transfected with mutant MRE11, we experimentally tried to confirm the role of MRE11 in conferring sensitivity to PARP-1 inhibition. Both models led to changes in proliferation in response to ABT-888 at different concentrations, and a drug-response effect was not observed, suggesting a possible contribution of additional genes.

We describe a strategy for designing cost-effective two-stage GWA studies. Our strategy preserves much of the power of the corresponding one-stage design and minimizes the genotyping cost of the study while allowing for differences in per genotyping cost between stages 1 and 2. We show that the ratio of stage 2 to stage 1 per genotype cost can strongly influence both the optimal design and the genotyping cost of the study. Increasing the stage 2 per genotype cost shifts more of the genotyping and study cost to stage 1, and increases the cost of the study. This higher cost can be partially mitigated by adopting a design with reduced power while preserving the false positive rate or by increasing the false positive rate while preserving power. For example, reducing the power preserved in the two-stage design from 99 to 95% that of the one-stage design decreases the two-stage study cost by approximately 15%.

Members of the Expert Panel had wide research experience including survey design, food security, food consumption, nutritional status, health-related conditions associated with nutritional status, and nutrition and public policy. The varied backgrounds of the Panel members led to consideration of the concept of core indicators of nutritional status from a broad perspective. Early in their discussions the Expert Panel recognized that public health officials and policymakers use information on nutritional status for the purposes of problem identification, program planning and resource direction, and program and policy evaluation. This recognition raised several issues which formed the conceptual framework for subsequent discussions, study conclusions, and research recommendations. These issues centered on the following concepts: the purpose for which data are used determines the suitability of indicators; the scope of information required varies for the purposes identified above; a broad range of indicators is needed to supply information useful for public policy decisions on nutrition; that is, assessment of the nutritional status of populations by measurement of dietary intakes of nutrients and anthropometric, biochemical, and clinical indices can provide only a portion of the information needed for these purposes in the United States; nutritional problems in the U.S. general population may signal some, but not all, anticipated nutritional concerns for difficult-to-sample populations; and, adequate coverage and suitable sampling methods are overriding concerns for obtaining interpretable data and appear to be a larger issue than suitable measures for nutritional assessment in the case of difficult-to-sample populations. Guided by consideration of these issues, the Expert Panel recognized that they could not provide a comprehensive design for the evaluation of nutritional status for all difficult-to-sample populations that would be appropriate for all public health and policy purposes. Therefore, the Expert Panel concentrated their discussions on enumeration of the various issues that must be considered in planning any effort to evaluate the nutritional concerns for such populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)');

A dysarthria assessment was performed a mean +/- SD of 31 +/- 15 months (range, 10-53 months) before death. The deviant speech dimensions were rated on a scale of 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). The neuropathological examination consisted of semiquantitative analysis of neuronal loss and gliosis by investigators (A.A.F.S., and L.A.B.) blinded to the clinical findings. Correlation and linear regression analysis were used to correlate the severity of the hypokinetic, spastic, and ataxic components with the degree of neuronal loss and gliosis in predetermined anatomical sites.All patients had hypokinetic and spastic dysarthria, and 9 also had ataxic components. The severity of the hypokinetic components was significantly correlated with the degree of neuronal loss and gliosis in the substantia nigra pars compacta (r = 0.61, P =.02) and pars reticulata (r = 0.64, P =.01) but not in the subthalamic nucleus (r = 0.51, P =.07) or the striatum or globus pallidus (/r/<0.34, P>.20).

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(975,19673864,'A surrogate marker (S) is a variable that can be measured earlier and often more easily than the true endpoint (T) in a clinical trial. Most previous research has been devoted to developing surrogacy measures to quantify how well S can replace T or examining the use of S in predicting the effect of a treatment (Z). However, the research often requires one to fit models for the distribution of T given S and Z. It is well known that such models do not have causal interpretations because the models condition on a postrandomization variable S. In this article, we directly model the relationship among T, S, and Z using a potential outcomes framework introduced by Frangakis and Rubin (2002, Biometrics 58, 21-29). We propose a Bayesian estimation method to evaluate the causal probabilities associated with the cross-classification of the potential outcomes of S and T when S and T are both binary. We use a log-linear model to directly model the association between the potential outcomes of S and T through the odds ratios. The quantities derived from this approach always have causal interpretations. However, this causal model is not identifiable from the data without additional assumptions. To reduce the nonidentifiability problem and increase the precision of statistical inferences, we assume monotonicity and incorporate prior belief that is plausible in the surrogate context by using prior distributions. We also explore the relationship among the surrogacy measures based on traditional models and this counterfactual model. The method is applied to the data from a glaucoma treatment study.');

It has also been demonstrated in other organ systems that the types of cell adhesion molecules on the surface of endothelial cells lining the organ microvasculature are determined, in part, by the ECM of the organ. We investigated how prostate cancer cell adhesion to HBME cells is affected by growing HBME cells on selected organ-derived ECM proteins in vitro. Growth of HBME cells and immortalized human aortic endothelial cells on bone, kidney, and placenta ECM proteins significantly increased their ability to bind PC-3 cells. This increased adhesion was not dose dependent and was not demonstrated with human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Scanning electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that prostate cancer cells adhered directly to the endothelial cells and not to the underlying substrata. These results suggest that unidentified cell adhesion molecules are expressed or up-regulated on the apical surfaces of human aortic endothelial cells and HBME cells grown on bone, kidney, and placenta ECMs. These results also strongly demonstrate that the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to bone may be initiated by direct binding to endothelial cells rather than direct binding to exposed ECM components.');

To identify early acting regulators, we capitalized on non-dividing heterokaryons (mouse embryonic stem cells fused to human fibroblasts), in which reprogramming towards pluripotency is efficient and rapid, enabling the identification of transient regulators required at the onset. We used bi-species transcriptome-wide RNA-seq to quantify transcriptional changes in the human somatic nucleus during reprogramming towards pluripotency in heterokaryons. During heterokaryon reprogramming, the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6), which is not detectable at significant levels in embryonic stem cells, was induced 50-fold. A 4-day culture with IL6 at the onset of iPS reprogramming replaced stably transduced oncogenic c-Myc such that transduction of only Oct4, Klf4 and Sox2 was required. IL6 also activated another Jak/Stat target, the serine/threonine kinase gene Pim1, which accounted for the IL6-mediated twofold increase in iPS frequency. In contrast, LIF, another induced GP130 ligand, failed to increase iPS frequency or activate c-Myc or Pim1, thereby revealing a differential role for the two Jak/Stat inducers in iPS generation. These findings demonstrate the power of heterokaryon bi-species global RNA-seq to identify early acting regulators of reprogramming, for example, extrinsic replacements for stably transduced transcription factors such as the potent oncogene c-Myc.');

This scenario can be observed when the cases can be further classified in terms of the seriousness or progression of the disease, for example, according to different stages of cancer. We explore several popular models for ordered categorical data in this context. We first adopt a cumulative logit or equivalently, a proportional-odds model to account for the ordinal nature of the data.

The time to threshold crossing may be the outcome variable in a survival analysis, or a time-dependent covariate in the analysis of a subsequent event. This paper presents new methods for analysing threshold-crossing data that are interval censored in that the time of threshold crossing is known only within a specified interval. Such data typically arise in event-history studies when the threshold is crossed at some time between data-collection points, such as visits to a clinic. We propose methods based on multiple imputation of the threshold-crossing time with use of models that take into account values recorded at the times of visits. We apply the methods to two real data sets, one involving hip replacements and the other on the prostate specific antigen (PSA) assay for prostate cancer. In addition, we compare our methods with the common practice of imputing the threshold-crossing time as the right endpoint of the interval. The two examples require different imputation models, but both lead to simple analyses of the multiply imputed data that automatically take into account variability due to imputation.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(995,19122184,'Previous research with female sheep indicates that exposure to excess testosterone for 60 days (from Gestational Days 30-90 of the 147-day gestation) leads to virilized genitalia, severe neuroendocrine deficits, as well as masculinization and defeminization of sexual behavior (T60 females). In contrast, 30 days of testosterone exposure (Gestational Days 60-90) produce animals with female-typical genitalia, less severe neuroendocrine alterations, and variable gender patterns of sexual behavior (T30 females). Variation in adult sexual behavior of male ungulates is influenced by early social experience, but this has never been tested in females. Here we investigate the influence of rank in the dominance hierarchy on the expression of adult sexual behavior in females. Specifically, we hypothesized that juvenile rank would predict the amount of male- and female-typical mating behavior exhibited by adult female sheep. This hypothesis was tested in two treatment groups and their controls (group 1: T60 females; group 2: T30 females). Dominance hierarchies were determined by observing competition over resources. Both groups of prenatal testosterone-treated females were higher ranking than controls (T60: P = 0.05; T30: P < 0.01). During the breeding season, both T60 and T30 females exhibited more male-typical mating behavior than did controls; however, the T30 animals also exhibited female-typical behavior. For the T60 group, prenatal treatment, not juvenile rank, best predicted male-typical sex behavior (P = 0.007), while juvenile rank better predicted male mating behavior for the T30 group (P = 0.006). Rank did not predict female mating behavior in the hormone-treated or control ewes. We conclude that the effect of prenatal testosterone exposure on adult male-specific but not female-specific mating behavior is modulated by juvenile social experiences.');

By monitoring PEMAX, the maximum between the absolute values of the standardized PWLR and PWKM, one combines advantages of rank-based (RB) and non-RB paired testing paradigms.

Periostin has been reported to be elevated in IPF patients relative to controls, but its sources and mechanisms of action remain unclear. We confirm excess periostin in lungs of IPF patients and show that IPF fibroblasts produce periostin. Blood was obtained from 54 IPF patients (all but 1 with 48 wk of follow-up). We show that periostin levels predict clinical progression at 48 wk (hazard ratio = 1.47, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-2.10, P < 0.05). Monocytes and fibrocytes are sources of periostin in circulation in IPF patients. Previous studies suggest that periostin may regulate the inflammatory phase of bleomycin-induced lung injury, but periostin effects during the fibroproliferative phase of the disease are unknown. Wild-type and periostin-deficient (periostin(-/-)) mice were anesthetized and challenged with bleomycin. Wild-type mice were injected with bleomycin and then treated with OC-20 Ab (which blocks periostin and integrin interactions) or control Ab during the fibroproliferative phase of disease, and fibrosis and survival were assessed. Periostin expression was upregulated quickly after treatment with bleomycin and remained elevated. Periostin(-/-) mice were protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Instillation of OC-20 during the fibroproliferative phase improved survival and limited collagen deposition. Chimeric mouse studies suggest that hematopoietic and structural sources of periostin contribute to lung fibrogenesis. Periostin was upregulated by transforming growth factor-Î² in lung mesenchymal cells, and periostin promoted extracellular matrix deposition, mesenchymal cell proliferation, and wound closure. Thus periostin plays a vital role in late stages of pulmonary fibrosis and is a potential biomarker for disease progression and a target for therapeutic intervention.');

Also, comparing pups that survived until birth at a high dose of the toxin with pups that survived at low doses may underestimate the effect of the toxin, because the lower dose means include the less healthy pups that would not survive if exposed to a higher level of toxin. We consider this problem in a potential outcomes framework that defines the effect of the dose on the outcome as the difference between what the outcome would have been for a pup had the dam in which the pup develops been exposed to dose level Z=z* rather than dose level Z=z. To disentangle the direct effect of dose from the effect of litter size, we focus on effects defined within principal strata that are a function of the survival status of the pups at each of the possible dose levels. A unique contribution to the potential outcomes literature is that we allow the outcome for a subject to be dependent on the principal stratum to which other subjects within a cluster belong.');

Previous work has focused on point or individual-level outcome data and few advances have been made when the outcome data are reported at an aggregated level, for example, at the county- or census-tract level. This article proposes a new class of spatial cluster detection methods for point or aggregate data, comprising of continuous, binary, and count data. Compared with the existing spatial cluster detection methods it has the following advantages. First, it readily incorporates region-specific weights, for example, based on a region''s population or a region''s outcome variance, which is the key for aggregate data. Second, the established general framework allows for area-level and individual-level covariate adjustment. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the method.

In a GWAS for high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) level, one strongly associated locus contains at least two biologically compelling candidates, methylmalonic aciduria cblB type (MMAB) and mevalonate kinase (MVK). To detect evidence of cis-acting regulation at this locus, we measured relative allelic expression of transcribed SNPs in five genes using human hepatocyte samples heterozygous for the transcribed SNP. If an HDL-C-associated SNP allele differentially regulates mRNA level in cis, samples heterozygous both for a transcribed SNP and an HDL-C-associated SNP should display allelic expression imbalance (AEI) of the transcribed SNP. We designed statistical tests to detect AEI in a comprehensive set of linkage disequilibrium (LD) scenarios between the transcribed SNP and an HDL-C-associated SNP (rs7298565) in phase unknown samples. We observed significant AEI of 22% in MMAB (P = 1.4 x 10(-13), transcribed SNP rs11067231), and the allele associated with lower HDL-C level was associated with greater MMAB transcript level. The same rs7298565 allele was also associated with higher MMAB mRNA level (P = 0.0081) and higher MMAB protein level (P = 0.0020). In contrast, MVK, UBE3B, KCTD10 and ACACB did not show significant AEI (P > or = 0.05).

In contrast, mRNA levels for apolipoprotein E (a constitutive hepatic protein not produced as part of the acute-phase response) were unchanged under identical conditions. Interleukin-1 also induced SAA mRNA in an endotoxin-resistant strain of mice (C3H/HeJ), indicating that this stimulation was not due to endotoxin contamination since endotoxin alone was unable to induce SAA mRNA in these mice.

Eight of 15 patients required mechanical ventilation at therapy onset. Etanercept was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg) twice weekly, for a maximum of 8 doses. Therapy was well tolerated with no infectious pulmonary complications noted. Ten of 15 patients had a complete response, defined as the ability to discontinue supplemental oxygen support during study therapy. The median time to complete response was 7 days (range, 3-18 days), with a day 28 survival of 73%. IPS onset was associated with elevations of several inflammatory proteins in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma, and response to therapy correlated with reductions in pulmonary and systemic inflammation. The combination of etanercept and corticosteroids is safe and is associated with high response rates and improved survival in patients with IPS.');

The hierarchical models extend the random effects models by including a (usually flat) prior on the regression coefficients and parameters in the distribution of the random effects. Because the MCMC can be implemented by the widely available BUGS or WinBUGS software packages, the computation burden of MCMC has been alleviated. However, thoughtfulness is essential in order to use this software effectively to analyze such data with complex structures. For example, we may have to reparameterize the model and standardize the covariates to accelerate the convergence of the MCMC, and then carefully monitor the convergence of the Markov chain. This article aims at resolving these issues in the application of the WinBUGS through the analysis of a real multi-level ordinal data. In addition, we extend the hierarchical model to include a wider class of distributions for the random effects. We propose to use the deviance information criterion (DIC) for model selection.

We argue that the compartmentalization of trials into the three standard phases, with non overlapping aims, is not necessary and in fact may slow the clinical development of agents. Combined Phase I/II trials and/or Phase I trials that at minimum collect efficacy data and more optimally include a preliminary measure of efficacy in dosing determination should be more widely utilized. Similarly, we posit that randomized Phase II trials should be used more frequently, as opposed to the traditional historical single arm Phase II trial that usually does not have a valid comparison group. The use of non binary endpoints is a simple modification that can improve the efficiency of early phase trials. The heterogeneity in scientific goals and contexts in early phase oncology trials is considerable, and the potential to improve the design to match these goals is great. We review these and other issues in the context of 5 manuscripts related to Phase II trials published in this volume. Our overall premise is that the potential benefits associated with the oncology clinical trial community moving away from the one size fits all paradigm of trial design are great, and that more flexible and efficient designs tailored to match the goals of each study are currently available and being used successfully.');

To identify other genes involved in the innate immune response, we challenged 16 inbred murine strains with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) systemically and measured serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha, and the chemokine KC 6 hr post-treatment. Loci that segregate with strain phenotypes were identified by whole genome association (WGA) mapping of cytokine concentrations. Published gene expression profiles and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were then utilized to prioritize loci and genes that potentially regulate the host response to LPS. Sixteen loci were selected for further investigation by combining WGA analysis with previously published QTL for murine response to LPS or gram negative bacteria. Thirty-eight genes within these loci were then selected for further investigation on the basis of the significance of the identified locus, transcriptional response to LPS, and biological plausibility. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of 4 of 38 candidate genes was shown to block the production of IL-6 in J774A.1 macrophages.

For both methods a future event or censoring time is imputed for each censored observation. With a categorical auxiliary variable, we show that with a large number of imputes the estimates from the Kaplan-Meier imputation method correspond to the weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator.

A problematic feature of the data is that two covariates of interest having missing values, so that only 75 per cent of the subjects have complete data. We handle the missing-data problem by jointly modelling the covariates and the outcomes, and then fitting the model to all of the data, including the incomplete cases.

The comparison with complete-case analysis demonstrates gains in efficiency for joint modelling as well as sensitivity of some results to the method used to handle missing data. The use of an indicator variable yields results that are very similar to those from joint modelling for our data. We also compare the results obtained for the mixture model with results obtained for a standard (non-mixture) survival model. It is seen that the mixture model separates out effects in a way that is not possible with a standard survival model.

To accommodate nonnormally distributed data, we developed and implemented a modified VC method, which we call the "copula VC method," that directly models the nonnormal distribution using Gaussian copulas. The copula VC method allows the analysis of continuous, discrete, and censored trait data, and the standard VC method is a special case when the data are distributed as multivariate normal. Through the use of link functions, the copula VC method can easily incorporate covariates.

Clinical and pathologic features were studied, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were immunostained for E-cadherin, estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR, respectively), and HER2/neu. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher''s exact test. All IBC uniformly expressed E-cadherin, whereas 15 of the 22 (68%) of the non-IBC expressed the protein (P = .006). Intralymphatic tumor emboli in the IBC cases were also all E-cadherin positive. Two IBC tumors demonstrated invasive lobular histology, and both cases were positive for E-cadherin. Of the non-IBC cases, three were invasive lobular carcinomas, and all were positive for E-cadherin.

Current methods for correcting measurement error with information from external calibration samples are insufficient to provide valid adjusted inferences. We consider the problem of estimating the regression of an outcome Y on covariates X and Z, where Y and Z are observed, X is unobserved, but a variable W that measures X with error is observed. Information about measurement error is provided in an external calibration sample where data on X and W (but not Y and Z) are recorded.We describe a method that uses summary statistics from the calibration sample to create multiple imputations of the missing values of X in the regression sample, so that the regression coefficients of Y on X and Z and associated standard errors can be estimated using simple multiple imputation combining rules, yielding valid statistical inferences under the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution.The proposed method is shown by simulation to provide better inferences than existing methods, namely the naive method, classical calibration, and regression calibration, particularly for correction for bias and achieving nominal confidence levels. We also illustrate our method with an example using linear regression to examine the relation between serum reproductive hormone concentrations and bone mineral density loss in midlife women in the Michigan Bone Health and Metabolism Study.Existing methods fail to adjust appropriately for bias due to measurement error in the regression setting, particularly when measurement error is substantial.

After controlling for donor and recipient characteristics using Cox regression models, we described the relationship between psoas area and post-transplantation mortality.Psoas area correlated poorly with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score and serum albumin. Cox regression revealed a strong association between psoas area and post-transplantation mortality (hazard ratio = 3.7/1,000 mm(2) decrease in psoas area; p < 0.0001). When stratified into quartiles based on psoas area (holding donor and recipient characteristics constant), 1-year survival ranged from 49.7% for the quartile with the smallest psoas area to 87.0% for the quartile with the largest. Survival at 3 years among these groups was 26.4% and 77.2%, respectively.

In comparing treatment options, the marginal recurrent event mean is frequently of interest. One major complication in the recurrent/terminal event setting is that censoring times are not known for subjects observed to die, which renders standard risk set based methods of estimation inapplicable. We propose two semiparametric methods for estimating the difference or ratio of treatment-specific marginal mean numbers of events. The first method involves imputing unobserved censoring times, while the second methods uses inverse probability of censoring weighting. In each case, imbalances in the treatment-specific covariate distributions are adjusted out through inverse probability of treatment weighting. After the imputation and/or weighting, the treatment-specific means (then their difference or ratio) are estimated nonparametrically. Large-sample properties are derived for each of the proposed estimators, with finite sample properties assessed through simulation. The proposed methods are applied to kidney transplant data.');

Geostatistics allows one to simulate the spatial distribution of pollutant concentrations over various spatial supports while incorporating both field data and predictions of deterministic dispersion models. This methodology was used in a companion paper to identify the census blocks that have a high probability of exceeding a given level of dioxin TEQ (toxic equivalents) around an incinerator in Midland, MI. This geostatistical model, along with population data, provided guidance for the collection of 51 new soil data, which permits the verification of the geostatistical predictions, and calibration of the model. Each new soil measurement was compared to the set of 100 TEQ values simulated at the closest grid node. The correlation between the measured concentration and the averaged simulated value is moderate (0.44), and the actual concentrations are clearly overestimated in the vicinity of the plant property line. Nevertheless, probability intervals computed from simulated TEQ values provide an accurate model of uncertainty: the proportion of observations that fall within these intervals exceeds what is expected from the model. Simulation-based probability intervals are also narrower than the intervals derived from the global histogram of the data, which demonstrates the greater precision of the geostatistical approach. Log-normal ordinary kriging provided fairly similar estimation results for the small and well-sampled area used in this validation study; however, the model of uncertainty was not always accurate. The regression analysis and geostatistical simulation were then conducted using the combined set of 53 original and 51 new soil samples, leading to an updated model for the spatial distribution of TEQ in Midland, MI.');

These data are generally consistent with those from other health surveys, which show that the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders increases for successive age categories, that such disorders are more common among women than among men, and that they are less prevalent among black persons than among persons of other races. In terms of both functional limitation and perceived health status, persons with musculoskeletal conditions are, with some notable exceptions, in relatively poor health. Persons having back problems in addition to problems with peripheral joints (such as the knee, hip, or shoulder) were more likely to rate their health as "fair" or "poor" compared with persons having only back problems or compared with persons in the civilian noninstitutionalized population as a whole. Musculoskeletal disorders accounted for a considerable proportion of all disability days reported by the total civilian noninstitutionalized population: 13 percent of restricted-activity days, 8.8 percent of bed-disability days, and 11.2 percent of all work-loss days were directly attributable to musculoskeletal conditions. The disabling effects of musculoskeletal problems pose a significant economic burden; they accounted for a total of $3.9 billion in lost productivity costs during 1980 for employed persons in the work force and for homemakers. For persons with musculoskeletal problems, the mean number of ambulatory visits per year was nearly twice the rate of 5.2 for the general civilian noninstitutionalized population. Of ambulatory visits made to all health care providers by persons with these conditions, 35.6 percent were related in some way to the treatment of their musculoskeletal problems. Musculoskeletal conditions are somewhat different from many other illnesses because their treatment is within the professional domain of several types of health care providers. Approximately 13 percent of persons with any type of musculoskeletal disorder received care from chiropractors during the year and this figure rose to nearly 30 percent for back problems only.

This method has the advantages of retaining patient characteristics when making imputation choices through the restricted mean parameters and does not make assumptions on the shapes of hazards or survival functions. Simulation results show that our method outperforms its closest competitor for modeling restricted mean lifetimes in terms of bias and efficiency in both independent censoring and dependent censoring scenarios. Survival estimates of restricted lifetime model parameters and marginal survival estimates regain much of the precision lost due to censoring.

Among the different ways to model recurrent/terminal event data, the marginal mean (i.e., averaging over the survival distribution) is of primary interest from a public health or health economics perspective. Often, the difference between treatment-specific recurrent event means will not be constant over time, particularly when treatment-specific differences in survival exist. In such cases, it makes more sense to quantify treatment effect based on the cumulative difference in the recurrent event means, as opposed to the instantaneous difference in the rates. We propose a method that compares treatments by separately estimating the survival probabilities and recurrent event rates given survival, then integrating to get the mean number of events. The proposed method combines an additive model for the conditional recurrent event rate and a proportional hazards model for the terminating event hazard. The treatment effects on survival and on recurrent event rate among survivors are estimated in constructing our measure and explain the mechanism generating the difference under study.

We included state-level covariates in the model-based approach through principal components.The national mammography screening prevalence estimate based on the BRFSS was substantially larger than the NHIS estimate for both time periods. This difference may have been due to nonresponse and noncoverage biases, response mode (telephone vs. in-person) differences, or other factors.

This enables us to analyze how the present disease status of a subject is influenced by his/her past exposure history conditional on the current ones. The joint likelihood formulation allows us to properly account for uncertainties associated with both stages of the estimation process in an integrated manner.

This latter association was strongest for US hemodialysis centers (AOR = 0.954 per day, p = 0.015).Dialysis facilities with shorter median hospital LOS for their patients have higher odds of readmission, particularly in the United States, where there is greater pressure to shorten LOS. The determinants and consequences of practices related to hospital LOS for hemodialysis patients should be further studied.');

Patient frailty is certainly a contributing factor, but is difficult to measure, with surgeons often relying on subjective or intuitive influences. We sought to use core muscle size as an objective measure of frailty, and determine its utility as a predictor of survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.Four hundred seventy-nine patients underwent elective open AAA repair between 2000 and 2008. Two hundred sixty-two patients (54.7%) had preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans available for analysis. Cross-sectional areas of the psoas muscles at the level of the L4 vertebra were measured. The covariate-adjusted effect of psoas area on postoperative mortality was assessed using Cox regression.Of the 262 patients, there were 55 deaths and the mean length of follow-up was 2.3 years. Cox regression revealed a significant association between psoas area and postoperative mortality (P = .003). The effect of psoas area was found to decrease significantly as follow-up time increased (P = .008). Among all covariates included in the Cox models (including predictors of mortality such as American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] score), the psoas area was the most significant.Core muscle size, an objective measure of frailty, correlates strongly with mortality after elective AAA repair. A better understanding of the role of frailty and core muscle size may aid in risk stratification and impact timing of surgical repair, especially in more complex aortic operations.');

Onset of bone loss resulting from disease increases the risk of incurring fractures and subsequent pain, increasing medical expenses while reducing quality of life. Although current standard CT-based protocols provide adequate prognostic information for assessing bone loss, many of the techniques for evaluating CT scans rely on measures based on whole-bone summary statistics. This reduces the sensitivity at identifying local regions of bone resorption, as well as formation. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a voxel-based image post-processing technique, called the Parametric Response Map (PRM), for identifying local changes in bone mass in weight-bearing bones on CT scans using an established animal model of osteoporosis. Serial CT scans were evaluated weekly using PRM subsequent to ovariectomy or sham surgeries over the period of one month. For comparison, bone volume fraction and mineral density measurements were acquired and found to significantly differ between groups starting 3 weeks post-surgery. High resolution ex vivo measurements acquired four weeks post-surgery validated the extent of bone loss in the surgical groups. In contrast to standard methodologies for assessing bone loss, PRM results were capable of identifying local decreases in bone mineral by week 2, which were found to be significant between groups. This study concludes that PRM is able to detect changes in bone mineral with higher sensitivity and spatial differentiation than conventional techniques for evaluating CT scans, which may aid in clinical decision making for patients suffering from bone loss.');

During the protein challenge, cortisol and DHEA declined over 5 h. During OGTT, cortisol and DHEA increased after the third hour and began to show significant divergence from protein from the fourth hour (P <or= 0.01).

HRD50 values increased with decrease in dose per fraction even when changing from 1.6 Gy to 1.15 Gy per fraction. The plots of the reciprocal of isoeffective doses versus dose per fraction are nonlinear suggesting either inappropriateness of the linear-quadratic model over the whole range of doses, or incompleteness of repair given as they were, at 3-h intervals. Allowing for incomplete repair, estimates for the alpha/beta ratio were 3.1 Gy and 1.7 Gy for the complete data set or for doses less than 7 Gy, respectively. The steep slope of the isoeffect curve plotting total dose versus dose per fraction was comparable to late responding normal tissues like lung, kidney and spinal cord. Such a response is consistent with slow proliferation of the matrix cells of resting follicles. The same animals were kept to assess the effect of dose fractionation on lethal injury to the lung.

Data utilized in this investigation were obtained from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register (CORR). The study population consisted of the 6400 patients aged 60 and over at registration, diagnosed between 1987 and 1993, for whom data on comorbid conditions were available. Survival probability, death rates, age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and Cox regression analysis were employed to evaluate the survival experience among the transplant and dialysis groups. Transplant recipients were matched (by age, underlying diagnosis leading to ESRD, and number of comorbid conditions) to 2 randomly selected patients who did not undergo transplantation. Using Cox regression, the time-dependent hazard ratio for transplantation versus dialysis patients was estimated at 0.47 (P < 0.0001), indicating that even after adjusting for other known prognostic factors, elderly patients who received a transplant experienced significantly greater survival probability than those who remained on dialysis. When transplant patients were matched to randomly selected dialysis patients with the constraint that the corresponding dialysis patient have at least as much follow-up time as the transplant patient had waiting time, five-year survival rates were 81% and 51% for the transplant and dialysis groups, respectively (P < 0.0001).

Despite this decline, a larger proportion of patients are listed as either Status 1A or 1B, likely secondary to increased use of mechanical circulatory support.

Visual field progression was analyzed using repeated measures models.Visual field progression, measured by Humphrey 24-2 full-threshold testing and assessed by the change in the mean deviation (MD), and an indicator of substantial worsening of the VF (MD decrease of > or =3 dB from baseline), assessed at each follow-up visit.Follow-up indicated minimal change from baseline in each initial treatment group''s average MD. However, at the 8-year follow-up examination, substantial worsening (> or =3 dB) of MD from baseline was found in 21.3% and 25.5% of the initial surgery and initial medicine groups, respectively. The effect of initial treatment on subsequent VF loss was modified by time (P<0.0001), baseline MD (P = 0.03), and diabetes (P = 0.01). Initial surgery led to less VF progression than initial medicine in subjects with advanced VF loss at baseline, whereas subjects with diabetes had more VF loss over time if treated initially with surgery.The CIGTS intervention protocol led to a lowering of IOP that persisted over time in both treatment groups.

The proportion of individuals exceeding clinical cut points for high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides varied according to an allelic dosage score (P < 10(-15) for each trend). These results suggest that the cumulative effect of multiple common variants contributes to polygenic dyslipidemia.');

In the longitudinal model, a biomarker is assumed to follow a semiparametric mixed model where covariate effects are modeled parametrically and subject-specific time profiles are modeled nonparametrially using a population smoothing spline and subject-specific random stochastic processes. The Cox model is assumed for survival data by including both the current measure and the rate of change of the underlying longitudinal trajectories as covariates, as motivated by a prostate cancer study application. We develop a two-stage semiparametric regression calibration (RC) method. Two variations of the RC method are considered, risk set regression calibration and a computationally simpler ordinary regression calibration. Simulation results show that the two-stage RC approach performs well in practice and effectively corrects the bias from the naive method. We apply the proposed methods to the analysis of a dataset for evaluating the effects of the longitudinal biomarker PSA on the recurrence of prostate cancer.');

Registration of in vivo imaging with histology was achieved using a mutual-information objective function and by performing ex vivo MRI of the prostatectomy specimen (obtained at 3 T) and whole-mount sectioning with block-face photography as intermediate steps. Data analysis included volumetrically registered whole-mount histology with Gleason scoring, (11)C-choline, and ADC data (obtained at 1.5 T). Volumes of interest were defined on the basis of histologically proven tumor tissue to calculate tumor-to-benign prostate background ratios (TBRs) for (11)C-choline, ADC, and a derived fusion PET/MRI parameter calculating the quotient of (11)C-choline over ADC (P(CHOL/ADC)).Fifty-one tumor nodules were identified at pathology. The TBRs for (11)C-choline (P < 0.05) and P(CHOL/ADC) (P < 0.005) were significantly higher in prostate cancers with a Gleason score of â¥3 + 4 than with a Gleason score of â¤3 + 3 disease and controls.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1114,14557111,'The ultimate success of microarray technology in basic and applied biological sciences depends critically on the development of statistical methods for gene expression data analysis. The most widely used tests for differential expression of genes are essentially univariate. Such tests disregard the multidimensional structure of microarray data. Multivariate methods are needed to utilize the information hidden in gene interactions and hence to provide more powerful and biologically meaningful methods for finding subsets of differentially expressed genes. The objective of this paper is to develop methods of multidimensional search for biologically significant genes, considering expression signals as mutually dependent random variables. To attain these ends, we consider the utility of a pertinent distance between random vectors and its empirical counterpart constructed from gene expression data. The distance furnishes exploratory procedures aimed at finding a target subset of differentially expressed genes. To determine the size of the target subset, we resort to successive elimination of smaller subsets resulting from each step of a random search algorithm based on maximization of the proposed distance. Different stopping rules associated with this procedure are evaluated. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated with an application to the analysis of two sets of gene expression data.');

We illustrate them using a study of prenatal vulnerability to lead in relation to Bayley''s Mental Development Index at 24 months of age (MDI24).The estimated change in MDI24 score with a 1-loge-unit increase in blood lead during the first trimester was -2.74 [95% confidence interval (CI), -5.78 to 0.29] based on a window-specific regression. The corresponding change in MDI24 was -4.13 (95% CI, -7.54 to -0.72) based on a multiple informant model; estimated effects were similar across trimesters (p = 0.23). Results from method 3 suggested that blood lead levels in early pregnancy were significantly associated with reduced MDI24, but decreasing blood leads over the course of pregnancy were not. Method 4 results indicated that blood lead levels before 17 weeks of gestation were lower among children with MDI24 scores in the 90th versus the 10th percentile (p = 0.08).Method 2 is preferred over method 1 because it enables formal testing of differences in effects across a priori-defined windows (e.g., trimesters of pregnancy). Methods 3 and 4 are preferred over method 2 when there is large variability in the timing of exposure assessments among participants.

In the context of Cox regression modeling, the most frequent solution is to apply a model that assumes the treatment effect is either piecewise constant or varies smoothly over time, i.e., the Cox nonproportional hazards model. This approach has at least two major limitations. First, it is generally difficult to assess whether the parametric form chosen for the treatment effect is correct. Second, in the presence of nonproportional hazards, investigators are usually more interested in the cumulative than the instantaneous treatment effect (e.g., determining if and when the survival functions cross). Therefore, we propose an estimator for the aggregate treatment effect in the presence of nonproportional hazards. Our estimator is based on the treatment-specific baseline cumulative hazards estimated under a stratified Cox model. No functional form for the nonproportionality need be assumed. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived, and the finite-sample properties are assessed in simulation studies. Pointwise and simultaneous confidence bands of the estimator can be computed. The proposed method is applied to data from a national organ failure registry.');

A retrospective analysis was performed on 68 OLT patients with donor liver biopsies and posttransplantation liver biopsies. Individual medical charts were reviewed for demographics, indication for OLT, serial histology reports, genotypes for hepatitis C, comorbid conditions, and medications. Liver biopsies were reviewed blindly and graded according to the Brunt Scoring System. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study the risk factors for developing NAFLD. The interval time from OLT to subsequent follow-up liver biopsy was 28 +/- 18 months. A total of 12 patients (18%) developed de novo NAFLD, and 6 (9%) developed de novo NASH. The regression model indicated that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) was associated with a reduced risk of developing NAFLD after OLT (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.010-0.92; P = 0.042).

We examined the statistical implications of using moving violations to determine crash responsibility in young driver crashes by comparing it with a method based on crash-contributing driver actions.

For each driver, crash responsibility was determined from the crash report using two alternative methods: (1) issuance of a moving violation citation; and (2) presence of a driver action (e.g., failure to yield, inattention). Overall, 18% of crash-involved drivers were issued a moving violation while 50% had a driver action. Only 32.2% of drivers with a driver action were cited for a moving violation. Further, the likelihood of being cited given the presence of a driver action was higher among certain driver subgroups-younger drivers, male drivers, and drivers in single-vehicle and more severe crashes. Specifically among young drivers, those driving at night, carrying peer passengers, and having a suspended or no license were more often cited. Conversely, fatally-injured drivers were almost never cited. We also demonstrated that using citation data may lead to statistical bias in the characterization of at-fault drivers and of quasi-induced exposure measures.

Three years later, 495 of these 664 men were still living. 99 of these (20%) had been diagnosed with osteoporosis, 72 (15%) had a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, and 89 (18%) had ever been prescribed a bisphosphonate. Overall, only 126 (25%) men had chart documentation indicating some recognition by the provider of the abnormality reported on CXR.

The slope of the single-dose survival curve is described by a D0 value of 1.47 Gy over a dose range 5 to 10 Gy. A weighted, nonlinear regression analysis of the multifraction data gave estimates of alpha/beta of 6.5 Gy for the linear quadratic model. The same analysis suggests that there are about four clonogenic melanocytes per hair follicle. There was a fluctuating pattern of recovery in the early hours after exposure to a dose of 4.0 Gy but no evidence of melanocyte regeneration up to 4 days. However, a characteristic of the data was its variability, suggesting that the radiation response of melanocytes over the dose range 0.9 to 10 Gy may be very variable, reflecting, perhaps, variability in the kinetic status of the melanocyte.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1135,18615411,'The annual percent change (APC) has been used as a measure to describe the trend in the age-adjusted cancer incidence or mortality rate over relatively short time intervals. The yearly data on these age-adjusted rates are available from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute. The traditional methods to estimate the APC is to fit a linear regression of logarithm of age-adjusted rates on time using the least squares method or the weighted least squares method, and use the estimate of the slope parameter to define the APC as the percent change in the rates between two consecutive years. For comparing the APC for two regions, one uses a t-test which assumes that the two datasets on the logarithm of the age-adjusted rates are independent and normally distributed with a common variance. Two modifications of this test, when there is an overlap between the two regions or between the time intervals for the two datasets have been recently developed. The first modification relaxes the assumption of the independence of the two datasets but still assumes the common variance. The second modification relaxes the assumption of the common variance also, but assumes that the variances of the age-adjusted rates are obtained using Poisson distributions for the mortality or incidence counts. In this paper, a unified approach to the problem of estimating the APC is undertaken by modeling the counts to follow an age-stratified Poisson regression model, and by deriving a corrected Z -test for testing the equality of two APCs. A simulation study is carried out to assess the performance of the test and an application of the test to compare the trends, for a selected number of cancer sites, for two overlapping regions and with varied degree of overlapping time intervals is presented.');

Multiple studies have attempted to create prognostic groupings of these patients in the perioperative phase, using information available regarding several clinicopathologic variables. Such groupings allow physicians to make early yet prudent decisions regarding adjuvant combination therapies. The current study presents results from a statistical analysis that enables the natural identification of such prognostic groups.Examination of consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens was performed between January 1991 and December 1995 at Wayne State University, Harper Hospital, Detroit, Michigan. Disease free survival in a cohort of 485 of these men was analyzed using recursive partitioning and amalgamation technique. Clinicopathologic parameters evaluated included age, race, preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical and pathologic stage, and Gleason grade of the fine-needle biopsy as well as the radical prostatectomy specimen.A binary decision tree representation was generated for classifying patients based on the clinicopathologic variables mentioned earlier. The worst prognosis was for patients with either advanced stage and a PSA level > 24.1 ng/mL or advanced stage, a PSA level </= 24.1 ng/mL, and age </= 65 years. This group had an estimated median disease free survival of only 10.3 months. Patients with lower pathologic stage, prostatectomy Gleason scores of </= 7, and a preoperative PSA level </= 22.7 ng/mL had the best prognosis.The recursive partitioning analyses allows easy characterization of a patient for prognosis shortly after radical prostatectomy. This will enable a physician to make more prudent decisions regarding whether to employ watchful waiting, proceed with accepted adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy or hormonal therapy), or refer patients to a research center that is able to administer experimental adjuvant therapy.

Examination of plastic-adherent cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage samples obtained from 76 human lung transplant recipients revealed clonal proliferation of fibroblast-like cells in 62% (106 of 172) of samples. Immunophenotyping of these isolated cells demonstrated expression of vimentin and prolyl-4-hydroxylase, indicating a mesenchymal phenotype. Multiparametric flow cytometric analyses revealed expression of cell-surface proteins, CD73, CD90, and CD105, commonly found on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Hematopoietic lineage markers CD14, CD34, and CD45 were absent. Multipotency of these cells was demonstrated by their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes. Cytogenetic analysis of cells from 7 sex-mismatched lung transplant recipients harvested up to 11 years after transplant revealed that 97.2% +/- 2.1% expressed the sex genotype of the donor.

Three key groups emerged who were more likely than their counterparts to belong to the distractions/external forces than the everything class and for whom targeted messaging might be effective: males, non-white adolescents, and teens who had experienced an injury crash as a driver.The classes appear to organize around the locus of control (LOC) social learning framework, with some teens perceiving crashes resulting primarily from their own behavior and others believing that forces in their environment determine the events that result in a crash. Designing interventions that help young drivers understand their role in crashes may help improve the safety behavior of young drivers.

NHG was associated with a poorer prognosis for both LN positive and LN negative patients, with hazard ratios of 1.651 (P < 0.001) and 1.437 (P=0.045), respectively, for an increase of one grade. Among LN negative patients, this survival disadvantage was observed only for those who received perioperative chemotherapy. For LN positive patients, an increase of one grade resulted in a significant overall survival disadvantage regardless of whether prolonged or perioperative chemotherapy was given. For LN negative patients grouped by grade, there was no observed difference in overall or disease free survival according to whether perioperative chemotherapy or no adjuvant therapy was given. However, LN positive patients with Grade 3 tumors had a significantly greater overall and disease free survival benefit from prolonged chemotherapy than from perioperative chemotherapy (P=0.016 and P=0.013, respectively); LN positive patients with Grade 1 or 2 disease in both treatment arms had comparable overall and disease free survival. A strong correlation between the previously utilized Bloom-Richardson grading system (BRG) and NHG was observed (P < 0.001 and kappa=82%) and no apparent differences in overall and disease free survival were observed between the two systems. NHG did, however, identify a greater proportion of tumors as Grade 1, and BRG identified a greater proportion of breast carcinomas as Grade 3.This multicenter clinical study confirms the value of histologic grade, and the authors propose that this technique be used to identify Grade 3, LN positive patients who will benefit from prolonged rather than perioperative chemotherapy.');

A genetic association was observed between apolipoprotein E (ApoE) allele epsilon 4 and FAD in late-onset families; the epsilon 4 allele frequency was .51 in affected subjects, .37 in at-risk subjects, .11 in spouses, and .19 in unrelated controls. The differences between the epsilon 4 frequencies in affected subjects versus controls and in at-risk subjects versus controls were highly significant (standard normal deviate [ZSND]) = 7.37, P < 10(-9); and ZSND = 4.07, P < .00005, respectively). No association between the epsilon 4 allele and FAD was observed in the ENVG or VG groups. A statistically significant allelic association between epsilon 4 and AD was also observed in a group of unrelated subjects; the epsilon 4 frequency was .26 in affected subjects, versus .19 in controls (ZSND = 2.20, P < .03). Evidence of linkage of ApoE and ApoCII to FAD was examined by maximum-likelihood methods, using three models and assuming autosomal dominant inheritance: (1) age-dependent penetrance, (2) extremely low (1%) penetrance, and (3) age-dependent penetrance corrected for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). For ApoCII in late-onset families, results for close linkage were negative, and only small positive lod-score-statistic (Z) values were obtained (model 1, maximum Z[Zmax] = 0.61, recombination fraction [theta] = .30; model 2, Zmax = 0.47, theta = .20). For ApoE in late-onset kindreds, positive Z values were obtained when either allele frequencies from controls (model 1, Zmax = 2.02, theta = .15; model 2, Zmax = 3.42, theta = .05) or allele frequencies from the families (model 1, Zmax = 1.43, theta = .15; model 2, Zmax = 1.70, theta = .05) were used.

Thirty-eight patient scans were partially analyzed and published previously, and 40 additional scans were used as a test set to evaluate previously determined classification indexes. In each patient, a series of color Doppler images was acquired and reconstructed into a volume encompassing a suspicious mass, identified by a radiologist-defined ellipsoid, in which six Doppler vascularity measures were calculated. Radiologist GS ratings and patient age were also recorded. Multivariable discrimination indexes derived from the learning set were applied blindly to the test set. Overall performance was also confirmed by using a fourfold cross-validation scheme on the entire population.By using all cases (46 benign, 32 malignant), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)) values confirmed results of previous analyses: Speed-weighted pixel density (SWPD) performed the best as a diagnostic index, although statistical significance (P = .01) was demonstrated only with respect to the normalized power-weighted pixel density. In both learning and test sets, the three-variable index (SWPD-age-GS) displayed significantly better diagnostic performance (A(z) = 0.97) than did any single index or the one two-variable index (age-GS) that could be obtained without the data from the Doppler scan. Results of the cross validation confirmed the trends in the two data sets.Quantitative Doppler US vascularity measurements considerably contribute to malignant breast tissue identification beyond subjective GS evaluation alone.

Factors controlled for include age, primary renal diagnosis, center size, and predialysis comorbid conditions.

No such relationship was found when an intent-to-treat Cox regression model was fit. Decreased covariable-adjusted mortality for CAPD/CCPD held within all subgroups defined by age and diabetes status, although the RRs increased with age and diabetes prevalence. The increased mortality on hemodialysis compared with CAPD/CCPD was concentrated in the first 2 years of follow-up.

Nonetheless, many phase I designs focus solely upon whether or not subjects experience toxicity, thereby determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with a binomial likelihood using data from fully observed subjects. The time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) was the first attempt to incorporate information from partially observed subjects by using a weighted binomial likelihood in which the weights are based upon the actual toxicity time distribution. Unfortunately, it is difficult to accurately estimate the toxicity time distribution because only a small proportion of enrolled subjects will experience toxicity. Creators of the TITE-CRM propose the simple alternative of weighting subjects by the proportion of time observed, as well as two adaptive weights to adjust for late-onset toxicities. As a alternative to these approaches, we suggest assuming the toxicity times, as a proportion of the total time under observation, have a Beta distribution with parameters 1.0 and theta; we also allow theta to vary by dose. The value of theta allows us to reflect the occurrence of early- or late-onset toxicities without correctly specifying the actual distribution of toxicity times. Through this model, we do not necessarily expect to improve identification of the MTD, but rather hope to reduce the exposure of subjects to overly toxic doses. Through simulation, we examine how well our model identifies the MTD and allocates dose assignments in three scenarios investigated by previous publications.');

Blood samples were collected from 20 of these individuals for preparation of DNA for use in screening of microsatellite repeat genetic markers via polymerase chain reaction.Eleven living family members covering 4 generations were diagnosed as affected with open-angle glaucoma of primarily juvenile onset. Four of 6 other at-risk individuals examined and enrolled were characterized as unaffected and two as indeterminate. Two additional individuals were not included in this study because they were too young to characterize or to provide a blood sample. Three spouses of affected family members were also examined and found not to have glaucoma. Of clinical importance was the finding of markedly elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in 2 affected brothers, both of whom were advised to have urgent filtration surgery; the finding of elevated IOP in the only seeing eye of the mother of these brothers, causing us to advise her to pursue more aggressive treatment; and the finding of early signs of glaucoma in a previously undiagnosed 9-year-old family member. Linkage analysis using selected microsatellite repeat markers in the 1q21-q31 region revealed strong evidence for linkage to the GLC1A gene with a maximum lod score of 3.75 for marker D1S431 at a recombination fraction of 0.00.The most likely interpretation of our data is that a mutation in the GLC1A gene is responsible for juvenile-onset POAG in this Panamanian family, thus expanding the countries of origin where this gene has been found to exist. The numbers of families with GLC1A glaucoma now reported from only a few centers worldwide raise questions about whether this disease may be more common than once thought. Evaluation of treatment histories and clinical outcomes in members of this and other previously reported families indicates that ophthalmologists need to understand the necessity for urgent filtration surgery in most cases of GLC1A glaucoma if vision is to be preserved.');

Further, few studies have examined the effect of age at smoking cessation on subsequent lung cancer death risk.The purpose of this study was to examine and compare absolute and relative lung cancer death risks in former smokers as a function of age at cessation.Using the American Cancer Society''s Cancer Prevention Study II, a prospective cohort study with 6 years of follow-up, we modeled absolute risk of lung cancer mortality in individuals who had never smoked and in current and former smokers. The model was fit with the use of person-years logistic regression analysis.Similar patterns of absolute risk of lung cancer death by age were found for all ages of smoking cessation up to the mid-60s. Lower lung cancer death risk was observed for those quitting earlier in life, and the risk for all former smokers was significantly lower than that for current smokers. For those quitting between ages 30 and 49, lung cancer death risk rose gradually with age at a rate slightly greater than that for those who had never smoked. Lung cancer death risk for former smokers quitting between ages 50 and 64 leveled off near the risk attained at the time of quitting until around age 75, when it rose sharply. At age 75, the RR for former smokers compared with current smokers was approximately 45% for those quitting in their early 60s, approximately 20% for those quitting in their early 50s, and less than 10% for those quitting in their 30s. For those who had never smoked, the RR at age 75 is less than 5%.In terms of reduced risk of lung cancer mortality, smoking cessation is beneficial at any age, with much greater benefits accruing to those quitting at younger ages. Unlike previous research, which has primarily examined the effects of cessation as a function of years since quitting, our results demonstrate that age at cessation has a major impact on subsequent lung cancer risks.Smokers of all ages should be encouraged to quit because cessation at any age decreases lung cancer risk relative to that of current smokers.');

QPCR was done to determine mRNA expression from 96 bladder tumors. Fifty-seven genes differentiated T2 from non-T2 tumors (P < 0.05). Principal components analysis and Cox regression models were used to predict probability of T2 progression for non-T2 patients, placing them into high- and low-risk groups based on their gene expression. At 2 years, high-risk patients exhibited greater T2 progression (45% for high-risk patients versus 12% for low-risk patients; P = 0.003, log-rank test). This difference remained significant within T1 tumors (61% for high-risk patients versus 22% for low-risk patients; P = 0.02) and Ta tumors (29% for high-risk patients versus 0% for low-risk patients; P = 0.03).

The predicted maximum reproductive success of 4.1+/-0.3 surviving offspring was attained at a fertility of 10.5 births. Eighty-three per cent of the women achieved a lifetime fertility level (7-13 births) for which the predicted mean reproductive success was within the confidence limits (3.4 to 4.8) for reproductive success at the optimal fertility level. Child mortality, rather than fertility, was the primary determinant of fitness.

A probability sample of 17980 children in 11506 crashes, representing 229106 children in 146613 crashes, was collected between December 1, 1998, and November 30, 2002. Parent reports were used to define restraint status, seating position, and occurrence of clinically significant injuries, with the use of a previously validated instrument.Approximately 62% of the children used seat belts, 35% used child restraints, and 3% used no restraint. Nearly 4 of 5 children sat in the rear seat, with one half of all children being restrained appropriately for their age in the rear, although this varied according to the age of the child. Overall, 1.6% of children suffered serious injuries, 13.5% had minor injuries, and 84.9% did not have any injury. Unrestrained children in the front were at the highest risk of injury and appropriately restrained children in the rear were at the lowest risk, for all age groups. Inappropriately restrained children were at nearly twice the risk of injury, compared with appropriately restrained children (odds ratio [OR]: 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-2.3), whereas unrestrained children were at >3 times the risk (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 2.5-4.1). The effect of seating row was smaller than the effect of restraint status; children in the front seat were at 40% greater risk of injury, compared with children in the rear seat (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.7). Had all children in the study population been appropriately restrained in the rear seat, 1014 serious injuries (95% CI: 675-1353 injuries) would have been prevented (with the assumption that restraint effectiveness does not depend on a variety of other driver-related, child-related, crash-related, vehicle-related, and environmental factors).Age-appropriate restraint confers relatively more safety benefit than rear seating, but the 2 work synergistically to provide the best protection for children in crashes. These results support the current focus on age-appropriate restraint in recently upgraded state child restraint laws. However, it is important to note that considerable added benefit would be realized with additional requirements for rear seating.');

We compared baseline characteristics, the use of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines class I recommendations, and in-hospital outcomes by the specialty of the primary in-patient service (cardiology versus noncardiology). A total of 35 374 patients (63.2%) were primarily cared for by a cardiology service, and these patients had lower-risk clinical characteristics, but they more commonly received acute (</=24 hours) medications, invasive cardiac procedures, and discharge medications and lifestyle interventions. Acute care processes were improved when care was provided by a cardiology service regardless of the propensity to receive cardiology care. The adjusted risk of in-hospital mortality was lower with care provided by a cardiology service (adjusted odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.88), and adjustment for differences in the use of acute medications and invasive procedures partially attenuated this mortality difference (adjusted odds ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.02).Non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients primarily cared for by a cardiology inpatient service more commonly received evidence-based treatments and had a lower risk of mortality, but these patients had lower-risk clinical characteristics.

However, strong linkage disequilibrium between markers in the 3'' portion of the gene has prevented further resolution of the QTL in Caucasian subjects. We have examined 10 ACE gene polymorphisms in Afro-Caribbean families recruited in JAMAICA: Variance components analyses showed strong evidence of linkage and association to circulating ACE levels. When the linkage results were contrasted with those from a set of British Caucasian families, there was no evidence for heterogeneity between the samples. However, patterns of allelic association between the markers and circulating ACE levels differed significantly in the two data sets. In the British families, three markers [G2215A, Alu insertion/deletion and G2350A] were in complete disequilibrium with the ACE-linked QTL. In the Jamaican families, only marker G2350A showed strong but incomplete disequilibrium with the ACE-linked QTL. These results suggest that additional unobserved polymorphisms have an effect on circulating ACE levels in Jamaican families.

Here, we examine the potential to conduct genealogical research in this population and present initial results indicating that accurate genealogical tracing for up to 17 generations is feasible. We also examine the clinical similarities of schizophrenia cases diagnosed in South Africa and those diagnosed in other, heterogeneous populations, specifically the US. We find that, with regard to basic sample descriptors and cardinal symptoms of disease, the two populations are equivalent. It is, therefore, likely that results from our genetic study of schizophrenia will be applicable to other populations.

Simulation results show that our method performs well in situations comparable with the LAS setting. Applying wait list and post-transplant model results that account for dependent censoring to wait list patients, we obtain estimates of transplant benefit that are larger for many of the more urgent patients in need of transplant. The difference in LAS for an individual, when properly accounting for dependent censoring, has high impact on the priority and timing of an organ offer for these patients.');

To deal with uncertainty in the order and location of markers, marker positions may be estimated conditional on the most likely marker order, plausible intervals for nonframework markers may be indicated on a framework map, or bins of markers may be constructed. We propose a statistical method for estimating marker position that combines information from all plausible marker orders, gives a measure of uncertainty in location for each marker, and provides an alternative to the current practice of binning. Assuming that the prior distribution for the retention probabilities is uniform and that the marker loci are distributed independently and uniformly on an interval of specified length, we calculate the posterior distribution of marker position for each marker. The median or mean of this distribution provides a point estimate of marker location. An interval estimate of marker location may be constructed either by using the 100(alpha/2) and 100(1-alpha)/2 percentiles of the distribution to form a 100(1-alpha) % posterior credible interval or by calculating the shortest 100(1-alpha) % posterior credible interval.

Twenty-nine patients underwent radical prostatectomy for a clinical T2b-c tumor or a stage T1c-T2a tumor and a serum prostate-specific antigen level > or =10ng/ml (radical prostatectomy alone), and 31 similarly staged patients received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy before radical prostatectomy (neoadjuvant). Bone marrow samples were used for RTPCR analysis. Twenty-four percent and 58% of the radical-prostatectomy-alone patients and neoadjuvant patients had organ-confined disease, respectively (P = 0.007). In the radical-prostatectomy-alone group, 77% and 14% of patients with extraprostatic and organ-confined disease were RTPCR positive, respectively (P = 0.03). However, in the neoadjuvant group, 46% and 28% of patients with extraprostatic and organ-confined disease were RTPCR positive, respectively (P = 0.29). For patients that were RTPCR positive, 45 % of the neoadjuvant patients had organ-confined disease compared with 6% in the radical-prostatectomy-alone patients (P = 0.018). These data suggest that a subset of the neoadjuvant patients are converted to organ confined disease without eliminating the prostate cells in the bone marrow. Our data suggest that hormonal therapy before radical prostatectomy decreases the occurrence of extraprostatic disease but, to a lesser degree, the incidence of circulating prostate cells. This may partially explain why hormonal therapy before radical prostatectomy has not improved disease-free survival.');

We have designed a gene-centric 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to assess potentially relevant loci across a range of cardiovascular, metabolic and inflammatory syndromes. The array utilizes a "cosmopolitan" tagging approach to capture the genetic diversity across approximately 2,000 loci in populations represented in the HapMap and SeattleSNPs projects. The array content is informed by GWAS of vascular and inflammatory disease, expression quantitative trait loci implicated in atherosclerosis, pathway based approaches and comprehensive literature searching. The custom flexibility of the array platform facilitated interrogation of loci at differing stringencies, according to a gene prioritization strategy that allows saturation of high priority loci with a greater density of markers than the existing GWAS tools, particularly in African HapMap samples. We also demonstrate that the IBC array can be used to complement GWAS, increasing coverage in high priority CVD-related loci across all major HapMap populations. DNA from over 200,000 extensively phenotyped individuals will be genotyped with this array with a significant portion of the generated data being released into the academic domain facilitating in silico replication attempts, analyses of rare variants and cross-cohort meta-analyses in diverse populations.

Ordered-subset analysis (OSA) identifies subsets of families defined by the level of a trait-related covariate that provide maximal evidence for linkage, without requiring a priori specification of the subset. We propose that examining evidence for linkage in the subset directly may result in a more etiologically homogeneous sample. In turn, the reduced impact of heterogeneity will result in increased overall evidence for linkage to a specific region and a more distinct lod score peak. In addition, identification of a subset defined by a specific trait-related covariate showing increased evidence for linkage may help refine the list of candidate genes in a given region and suggest a useful sample in which to begin searching for trait-associated polymorphisms.

A computer program was used to administer the standard gamble (SG) method and record utility score (US) for treatment options of a tooth with reversible pulpitis using the SG method. For the SG method, two anchor states were used: filled tooth with full oral health and filled tooth with severe and continuous pain leading to EXT. Additional data were obtained using a self-administered questionnaire.Out of the 807 adults who resided in 446 screened and selected households, a final sample of 630 adults who resided in 368 households were interviewed. The mean US for DR with 75 and 95% success rates were 72.5 and 86.2 (on a 0-100 scale), respectively. The US for RCT and immediate EXT were 75.6 and 31.3, respectively. Eleven per cent of the adults valued DR with 95% success probability higher than a simple filling with full oral health for life.

Therefore, we tested whether the aggregate effect of these loci is diminished in adults of European ancestry reporting high levels of physical activity. Twelve obesity-susceptibility loci were genotyped or imputed in 111,421 participants. A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated by summing the BMI-associated alleles of each genetic variant. Physical activity was assessed using self-administered questionnaires. Multiplicative interactions between the GRS and physical activity on BMI were tested in linear and logistic regression models in each cohort, with adjustment for age, age(2), sex, study center (for multicenter studies), and the marginal terms for physical activity and the GRS. These results were combined using meta-analysis weighted by cohort sample size.

The features of the MSA cases included autonomic failure and parkinsonism in 10 patients, autonomic failure without parkinsonism in six, and parkinsonism without autonomic failure in one. Using survival analysis methods, the authors estimated that 24% of subjects in this population will evolve to MSA within 5 years of the onset of sOPCA symptoms (95% CI 10% to 36%). An older age at onset of symptoms and a shorter time from onset of symptoms to first presentation in a neurology specialty clinic were both highly predictive of evolution to MSA. Six of the 17 patients who evolved to MSA died 4 months to 5 years after they had met diagnostic criteria for MSA. The estimated median survival time from time of transition was 3.5 years. In contrast, death occurred in only one of the 34 patients with sOPCA who did not evolve to MSA. Autopsy examination of all six patients with MSA who died confirmed the diagnosis.Approximately one-fourth of sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy patients will evolve to multiple system atrophy within 5 years, and this transition carries a poor prognosis for survival.

In this study, we generated transcriptional profiles of 11 adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), 4 adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs), 3 normal adrenal cortices (NCs), and 1 macronodular hyperplasia (MNH) using Affymetrix HG_U95Av2 oligonucleotide arrays representing approximately 10,500 unique genes. The expression data set was used for unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis as well as principal component analysis to visually represent the expression data. An analysis of variance on the three classes (NC, ACA plus MNH, and ACC) revealed 91 genes that displayed at least threefold differential expression between the ACC cohort and both the NC and ACA cohorts at a significance level of P < 0.01. Included in these 91 genes were those known to be up-regulated in adrenocortical tumors, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF2), as well as novel differentially expressed genes such as osteopontin (SPP) and serine threonine kinase 15 (STK15). Increased expression of IGF2 was identified in 10 of 11 ACCs (90.9%) and was verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

The factors considered were length of stay, morbidity and mortality, readmission rates, and average cost. The CCP was implemented on January 1, 1994. Its scope was to minimize preoperative evaluation, eliminate the preoperative hospital stay, standardize postoperative care and provide intensive patient education.The average length of stay decreased significantly after implementation of the CCP (8.1 vs. 4.9 days, p = 0.0001). In 1990, there was a large difference in length of stay between academic and private physicians (8.3 vs. 12.6 days) (p = 0. 02) but by 1 year after implementation of the CCP there was virtually no difference (4.69 vs. 4.71 days) (p > 0.05).

Mice in the multifractionated regimen groups were given a single 15 Gy top-up dose 24 h after reaching a cumulative fractionated dose of 24-70 Gy. Hind limb strength was measured weekly for 2 years after the completion of irradiation.Paralysis occurred in a bimodal time distribution, with peaks at 5-10 months and 15-23 months after the completion of irradiation. The cumulative radiation dose was directly associated with the incidence of paralysis in each radiation schedule (p < 0.0001) and inversely associated with the time to onset of paralysis in the 1.2 Gy b.i.d. (p = 0.0001) and 2.0 Gy q.d. schedules (p = 0.03). The median latency of paralysis in each group was inversely associated with the incidence of paralysis in that group (p < 0.001). Decreasing the fraction size from 2.0 to 1.2 Gy once daily markedly increased the radiation tolerance of the spinal cord (p < 0.0001), consistent with a very small alpha-beta value of -0.30 Gy (approximately 95% confidence interval -0.72, +0.18) in the linear-quadratic model. Decreasing the time interval from 24 h to alternating 8 and 16 h periods produced an offsetting diminuation in cord tolerance (p < 0.0001). The 1.2 Gy once daily schedule resulted in ED20 and ED50 values that were approximately double those of the 2.0 Gy once daily and the 1.2 Gy twice daily schedules and a relative risk of paralysis from a given dose that was 0.03 times the risk associated with the other two regimens (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the 2.0 Gy once daily and the 1.2 Gy twice daily dose-paralysis curves (p = 0.86). The residual from a single 12 Gy radiation dose was 17% after 190 days, leaving the retreatment ED50 only 10% below the ED50 of previously unirradiated spinal cord. The relative risk of paralysis after 12 Gy plus a second radiation dose decreased from 1.00 with no time interval between doses to 0.51-0.73 with a 0.25, 1 or 3 day interval, 0.32 with a 7 day interval, 0.11 with a 30 day interval, and 0.06 with a 190 day interval.The increased radiation tolerance of the murine spinal cord produced by decreasing the fraction size from 2.0 to 1.2 Gy was offset by the diminished tolerance produced by decreasing the time interval between fractions from 24 to 8-16 h, resulting in no significant difference in the dose-paralysis curves of conventional and hyperfractionated radiation schedules.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1240,20643874,'Matched cohort analyses and their extension to conditional logistic and Poisson regression are powerful tools for assessing risk and protective factors in automobile crashes. However, these analyses rely on assumptions about latent (unobserved) ''crash severity'' risk measures for subjects in the vehicle being common for all such subjects if confounding with crash severity is present. The assumptions may be questionable if adults are being matched to children.Simulations were conducted to evaluate conditional Poisson regression in settings where different types of subjects may have different underlying baseline summary risk measures in a given crash-for example, adults and children. Situations were considered where baseline summary risk measures and protective factors are confounded with each other and where the adult and child baseline risk measures are either highly correlated or weakly correlated.When the risk or protective factor is confounded with crash severity, baseline summary risk measures due to crash severity must be perfectly correlated for all subjects in the crash for the factor to be consistently estimated. Relative bias estimates ranged from 5% to 50% depending on the degree of correlation of the risk measure and the number of matched subjects in a crash.Matched cohort analysis and its regression extensions are useful tools in the injury epidemiology toolkit, but require assumptions about high correlation of baseline summary risk measures among adults and children to accurately account for confounding between risk or protective factors of interest by crash severity.

It implicitly assumes that the markers are in linkage equilibrium, a condition that is rarely satisfied and that we plan to relax.We carefully examined the impact of linkage disequilibrium (LD) on PCA, and proposed a simple modification of the standard PCA to automatically adjust for the correlations among markers.We demonstrated that LD patterns in genome-wide association datasets can distort the techniques for stratification control, showing ''subpopulations'' reflecting localized LD phenomena rather than plausible population structure. We showed that the proposed method effectively removes the artifactual effect of LD patterns, and successfully recovers underlying population structure that is not apparent from standard PCA.PCA is highly influenced by sets of SNPs with high LD, obscuring the true population substructure. Our shrinkage PCA applies to all available markers, regardless of the LD patterns. The proposed method is easier to implement than most existing LD adjusted PCA methods.');

This study tested whether increases in visceral adiposity, adipocyte size, and total free fatty acids underlie the insulin resistance seen in prenatal T-treated female sheep. At approximately 16 months of age, insulin resistance and adipose tissue partitioning were determined via hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and computed tomography, respectively, in control and prenatal T-treated females. Three months later, adipocyte size and free fatty acid composition were determined. Results revealed that at the postpubertal time points tested, insulin sensitivity was increased, visceral adiposity and adipocyte size in both the sc and the visceral compartments were reduced, and circulating palmitic acid was increased in prenatal T-treated females relative to controls. In parallel studies, 20-month-old prenatal T-treated females tended to have increased basal insulin to glucose ratio. Relative to earlier findings of reduced insulin sensitivity of prenatal T-treated females during early life and adulthood, these findings of increased insulin sensitivity and reduced adiposity postpubertally are suggestive of a period of developmental adaptation. The disruption observed in free fatty acid metabolism a few months later correspond to a time point when the insulin sensitivity indices of prenatal T-treated animals appear to shift toward insulin resistance. In summary, current findings of improved insulin sensitivity and reduced visceral adiposity in postpubertal prenatal T-treated sheep relative to our earlier findings of reduced insulin sensitivity during early postnatal life and adulthood are indicative of a period of developmental adaptation.');

Using McEwen''s stress theory of allostasis as a guidepost, this study examined whether pre- and postinjury chronic stress conditions could explain post-TBI depressive symptoms. Seventy-five community-dwelling persons who sustained a mild-to-moderate TBI and were within 2 years of the injury participated in this cross-sectional study. The participants completed measures of chronic stress and depression, measured with the Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory. Data were collected also on brain injury severity. Using multiple regression analysis, the frequency of childhood adversities and postinjury stress explained post-TBI depression. When time-since-injury was in the regression model, the frequency of preinjury stressors and postinjury stress significantly explained post-TBI depressive symptoms while the combined effect of childhood adversity with postinjury stress was not significant in explaining depressive symptoms. Pre- and postinjury chronic stress explained post-TBI depressive symptoms. These findings support stress-diathesis theory within the psychiatric literature and a linkage between chronic stress, an indicator of allostatic load, and post-TBI depression. These findings are important for nurse specialists working with persons who sustained brain injury, for chronic stress can be buffered by efficient and effective support systems.');

The effectiveness of therapy for individual brain cancer patients was evaluated by measuring changes in tumor volume on neuroimaging studies conducted 6--8 weeks after the conclusion of a treatment cycle.Diffusion MRI could detect water diffusion changes in orthotopic 9L gliomas after doses of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU or carmustine) that resulted in as little as 0.2 log cell kill, a measure of tumor cell death. Mean apparent diffusion coefficients in tumors were found to be correlated with and highly sensitive to changes in tumor cellularity (r =.78; two-sided P =.041). The feasibility of serial diffusion MRI in the clinical management of primary brain tumor patients was also demonstrated.

The primary statistical analysis used the Poly3 method to compare lymphoma incidences in magnetic field (MF)-exposed and control mice. Secondary analyses used the Cox proportional hazards model to analyze incidence rates for mortality and development of specific types of neoplasia. The mortality incidence rate was increased by ionizing radiation treatment, and all neoplasms were observed sooner in irradiated mice. However, the lifetime incidence of hematopoietic neoplasia was similar in all experimental groups, including those that were not exposed to ionizing radiation. Chronic exposure to MFs did not affect the mortality incidence rates and did not change the relative incidences of hematopoietic neoplasia in mice that received the same ionizing radiation treatment, with the exception of a marginally significant reduced relative risk of 0.97 (P = 0.05) for lymphoblastic lymphoma in mice exposed to a magnetic field and treated with 5.1 Gy. Lymphomas and histiocytic sarcomas were first observed approximately 50 days sooner in mice that were exposed to magnetic fields but not ionizing radiation, although this comparison was not statistically significant and the incidence of hematopoietic neoplasia in these mice was not different from that of mice in the 0 T/0 Gy group.');

Importance of readiness factors was dichotomized as "high" (very important or important) versus "low" (neither, unimportant, or very unimportant). Relationships between pediatricians'' responses and demographic information were explored using multivariate logistic regression.Most pediatricians (at least 81%) rated all 7 infant clinical factors (eg, stable, normal vital signs, successful feeding) as highly important determinants of discharge readiness. Women were 2 to 3 times more likely to rate maternal and peripartum factors such as maternal fatigue and stress, demonstration of maternal skills, breastfeeding knowledge or experience, adequacy of social support, maternal age <18 years, and low income/lack of financial resources as highly important. With respect to hospital LOS, women were twice as likely to identify an optimal LOS as >36 hours and a minimal LOS as >24 hours. Pediatricians in group settings were 3 times as likely as those in solo or 2-physician practices to advocate an optimal LOS >36 hours, and those with a high proportion of publicly insured or uninsured patients were less likely to identify an optimal LOS as >36 hours (odds ratio: 0.53).Female pediatricians report a more biopsychosocial approach to determining discharge readiness than their male counterparts, taking into account infant characteristics, maternal skills, and socioemotional issues that may affect the mother-infant pair''s adjustment at home.

BTB-Kelch proteins have been implicated in ubiquitination through Cullin E3 ligases. Notably, all three putative disease-causing KLHL7 mutations are within a conserved BACK domain; homology modeling suggests that mutant amino acid side chains can potentially fill the cleft between two helices, thereby affecting the ubiquitination complexes.

The authors recently cloned and characterized an antioxidant protein, SAG (sensitive to apoptosis gene), that is redox inducible and protects cells from apoptosis induced by redox agents in a number of in vitro cell model systems. This study reports a neuroprotective role of SAG in ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury in an in vivo mouse model. SAG was expressed at a low level in brain tissue and was inducible after middle cerebral artery occlusion with peak expression at 6 to 12 hours. At the cellular level, SAG was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons and astrocytes, revealed by double immunofluorescence. An injection of recombinant adenoviral vector carrying human SAG into mouse brain produced an overexpression of SAG protein in the injected areas. Transduction of AdCMVSAG (wild-type), but not AdCMVmSAG (mutant), nor the AdCMVlacZ control, protected brain cells from ischemic brain injury, as evidenced by significant reduction of the infarct areas where SAG was highly expressed. The result suggests a rather specific protective role of SAG in the current in vivo model. Mechanistically, SAG overexpression decreased reactive oxygen species production and reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the ischemic areas. Thus, antioxidant SAG appears to protect against reactive oxygen species-induced brain damage in mice. Identification of SAG as a neuroprotective molecule could lead to potential stroke therapies.');

We have now systemically analyzed and compared the expression of these markers in fresh ovarian epithelial carcinomas. Although the expression levels of these markers were unexpectedly variable and partially overlapping in fresh ovarian cancer cells from different donors, we reliably detected important levels of CD133 and ALDH in the majority of fresh ovarian cancer. Furthermore, most of these stem cell markers including CD133 and ALDH were gradually lost following in vitro passage of primary tumor cells. However, the expression of ALDH and CD133, but not CD24, CD44 and CD117, could be partially rescued by the in vitro serum-free and sphere cultures and by the in vivo passage in the immune-deficient xenografts. ALDH+ and CD133+ cells formed three-dimensional spheres more efficiently than their negative counterparts.

We review possibilities of using classical models proposed by Tukey (1949) and Mandel (1961) using the cell means of a two-way classification array for such data. Although these models are effective for detecting interactions in the presence of main effects, they fail miserably if the interaction structure is misspecified. We explore a more robust class of interaction models that are based on a singular value decomposition of the cell-means residual matrix after fitting the additive main effect terms. This class of additive main effects and multiplicative interaction models (Gollob, 1968) provide useful summaries for subject-specific and time-varying effects as represented in terms of their contribution to the leading eigenvalues of the interaction matrix. It also makes the interaction structure more amenable to geometric representation. We call this analysis ''principal interactions analysis''. While the paper primarily focuses on a cell-mean-based analysis of repeated measures outcome, we also introduce resampling-based methods that appropriately recognize the unbalanced and longitudinal nature of the data instead of reducing the response to cell means. We illustrate the proposed methods by using data from the Normative Aging Study, a longitudinal cohort study of Boston area veterans since 1963. We carry out simulation studies under an array of classical interaction models and common epistasis models to illustrate the properties of the principal interactions analysis procedure in comparison with the classical alternatives.');

Even after adjusting for location risk there is greater risk of accidents for facilities in heavily African-American counties (OR of accident = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.4).Further research and policy interventions are required to reduce the probability of locating facilities in an inequitable fashion, as well as health surveillance, and regulatory monitoring and enforcement activities to ensure that hazardous facilities in minority communities prepare and prevent accidental chemical releases to the same standards as elsewhere.');

Using analytic methods and computer simulation, we first consider the combinations of fragment retention rate, ploidy, and marker spacing that provide the best chance to order markers. We find that in general, combinations of ploidy and chromosome-specific retention rates that lead to a per-hybrid retention rate of approximately 50% result in the greatest power to order markers. We also find that analyzing polyploid radiation hybrids as if they were haploid does not compromise the ability to order markers but does result in less accurate intermarker distance estimates. Second, we examine the effect of typing errors on two-locus information, ability to order multiple loci, and estimation of intermarker distances and total map length. Even low levels of error result in large losses of information about breakage probabilities, markedly reduce ability to order loci, and inflate estimates of intermarker distances and total map length. We compare the ordering accuracy that results from duplicate typing of hybrids to that of single typing twice as many hybrids and find that duplicate typing results in a higher probability of identifying the true order as one of the best orders, but that single typing of twice as many hybrids results in stronger support for the true order. For low error rates, framework maps constructed from the larger single-typed panels are only slightly less likely to be correct and include substantially more markers than the smaller double-typed panels. Third, we develop a method to calculate the distribution of the number of obligate chromosome breaks for a polyploid radiation hybrid under a given locus order and discuss how this method may be used to identify hybrids with suspiciously large numbers of chromosome breaks.');

The objective of the current study was to investigate racial disparities in breast cancer treatment by conducting a comprehensive medical records review of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer at the Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) in Detroit, Michigan.The study cohort consisted of 651 women who were diagnosed with primary breast cancer between 1990 and 1996 at KCI. Multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for sociodemographic factors, tumor characteristics, comorbidities, and health insurance status was used to assess whether there were differences between WA and AA in the receipt of breast-conserving surgery (BCS), radiation, tamoxifen, and chemotherapy.There was no significant difference between WA and AA in the receipt of BCS versus mastectomy. Patients with local-stage disease who were enrolled in government insurance plans underwent mastectomy more often (vs BCS plus radiation) compared with patients who were enrolled in nongovernment plans. The rates of receipt of tamoxifen and chemotherapy were similar for local-stage WA and local-stage AA. However, WA were more likely to receive tamoxifen and/or chemotherapy for regional-stage disease.

To identify genetic contributors of plasma PUFA concentrations, we conducted a genome-wide association study of plasma levels of six omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in 1,075 participants in the InCHIANTI study on aging. The strongest evidence for association was observed in a region of chromosome 11 that encodes three fatty acid desaturases (FADS1, FADS2, FADS3). The SNP with the most significant association was rs174537 near FADS1 in the analysis of arachidonic acid (AA; p = 5.95 x 10(-46)). Minor allele homozygotes had lower AA compared to the major allele homozygotes and rs174537 accounted for 18.6% of the additive variance in AA concentrations. This SNP was also associated with levels of eicosadienoic acid (EDA; p = 6.78 x 10(-9)) and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA; p = 1.07 x 10(-14)). Participants carrying the allele associated with higher AA, EDA, and EPA also had higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and total cholesterol levels.

This method uses stratified longitudinal covariate information to get more precise estimates of the underlying survival curves when there is censored information and this leads to more powerful tests. Another important feature of the test is that it remains valid when informative censoring is captured by the incorporated covariate. In this case, the Pepe-Fleming statistic is known to be biased and should not be used.

Linear regression was used to estimate associations between area characteristics and insulin resistance after adjustment for age, sex, income, education, and race/ethnicity and for the potential mediators diet, physical activity, and body mass index (n = 4,821). Among persons not treated for diabetes, distance to a wealthy area was associated with HOMA independent of local poverty and person-level covariates: per 4.4-km change, the relative increase in HOMA was 13% (95% confidence interval: 7%, 19%), similar to the effect of a body mass index increase of 1.7 kg/m(2) on HOMA. This association was reduced after adjustment for physical activity, diet, and body mass index (relative increase = 9%, 95% confidence interval: 3%, 15%). Local neighborhood poverty was also positively, but more weakly associated with insulin resistance, with no association after adjustment for race/ethnicity. This study shows that proximity to resources in high-income areas is related to insulin resistance.');

Understanding the genetic basis of these adaptations is critical to intervening successfully against malaria. To that end, we created a high-density genotyping array that assays over 17,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (â¼ 1 SNP/kb), and applied it to 57 culture-adapted parasites from three continents. We characterized genome-wide genetic diversity within and between populations and identified numerous loci with signals of natural selection, suggesting their role in recent adaptation. In addition, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS), searching for loci correlated with resistance to thirteen antimalarials; we detected both known and novel resistance loci, including a new halofantrine resistance locus, PF10_0355. Through functional testing we demonstrated that PF10_0355 overexpression decreases sensitivity to halofantrine, mefloquine, and lumefantrine, but not to structurally unrelated antimalarials, and that increased gene copy number mediates resistance. Our GWAS and follow-on functional validation demonstrate the potential of genome-wide studies to elucidate functionally important loci in the malaria parasite genome.');

Median age was 60 years; median number of comorbidities was 3; 67% were not in remission. By using a Bayesian adaptive method to determine the best dose/schedule combination based on time to toxicity, the authors investigated combinations of 5 daily azacitidine doses, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 mg/m2, and 4 schedules: 1, 2, 3, or 4 cycles, each with 5 days of drug and 25 days of rest. Cycle 1 started on Day +40.Reversible thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. The optimal combination was 32 mg/m2 given for 4 cycles. Median follow-up was 20.5 months. One-year event-free and overall survival were 58% and 77%, justifying further studies to estimate long-term clinical benefit. No dose significantly affected DNA global methylation.Azacitidine at 32 mg/m2 given for 5 days is safe and can be administered after allogeneic transplant for at least 4 cycles to heavily pretreated AML/MDS patients. The trial also suggested that this treatment may prolong event-free and overall survival, and that more cycles may be associated with greater benefit.');

Climatic variables were determined by linkage to National Climatic Data Center of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data. Catheter care protocols were examined to determine if they could mitigate infection risk during high-risk seasons.

The average BMI was 26.3 kg/m2 for women and 21.4 kg/m2 for men. The prevalence of hypertension had a steep association with age and in women ranged from 15% (25-34 years) to 63% (55 years and over) and in men from 9% to 47%. No tobacco use in women and greater Na/K ratio in spot urines in men were significantly associated with an increased SBP. In both men and women the levels of hypertension and SBP were strongly positively associated with BMI, although the relationship appeared to plateau in women with a BMI greater than >/=25 kg/m2. At a given BMI, men and women had similar SBPs and prevalences of hypertension. There is a very high prevalence of hypertension among urban Zimbabweans, particularly among women.

Cytokines were measured using multiplex immune assay. mRNA expression for selected markers of viral infection was measured using RT-PCR. A cumulative respiratory symptom score was calculated for each day of measurement. Generalized estimated equations were used to evaluate associations between viral infection and marker elevation, and between marker elevation and symptom score.The 16 patients completed a total of 37 weeks of assessment (15 ''well'' weeks; 22 self-assessed ''sick'' weeks).

Women who perceived their worries as interfering with their functioning reported higher levels of anxiety and confusion, and diminished mental health and role functioning. The results add to the expanding area of anxiety/distress in at-risk populations by providing (1) a direct measure of the perceived interference associated with breast cancer-specific thoughts, (2) a validation of the measure via its associations with standard measures of emotional distress and health functioning, and (3) evidence of the measure''s incremental predictive value in explaining distress and quality of life, after consideration of background variables, such as having a family history of cancer.');

Nondiabetic individuals carrying the risk allele and individuals with T2D showed increased expression of the receptor in islets. Insulin release from clonal beta cells in response to glucose was inhibited in the presence of melatonin. These data suggest that the circulating hormone melatonin, which is predominantly released from the pineal gland in the brain, is involved in the pathogenesis of T2D.

Two dietary patterns were identified: a whole-foods pattern (characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruit, fish, poultry, and whole grains) and a Western pattern (characterized by high intakes of red and processed meats, refined grains, potatoes, and French fries). In multivariable analyses, significantly fewer deaths were observed in subjects most adherent to the whole-foods pattern (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.92; P-trend = 0.01). Subjects classified as overweight or obese had significantly fewer deaths (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.85; P = 0.001) and recurrences (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.95; P = 0.02) than did normal-weight or underweight subjects.Consumption of a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, fish, poultry, and whole grains and being overweight before diagnosis with head and neck cancer are associated with a better prognosis.');

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that surgical complications are associated with omission of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.We used the 1998 to 2005 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database to study adjuvant chemotherapy use among patients with stage III colorectal cancer who underwent surgical resection. Chemotherapy use was compared between patients with and without complications. Univariate analyses and multiple logistic regression were used to test the association between complications and chemotherapy omission, while adjusting for demographics, comorbidity, and other factors. Associations between complications and time to chemotherapy were also studied.We identified 17,108 eligible patients with stage III colorectal cancer (median age, 75 y; 24% rectal/rectosigmoid). Using a parsimonious list of complication codes, 18% of patients had â¥ 1 complication. Thirteen percent of patients had medical complications and 3.8% of patients had complications requiring reoperation or another procedure. Adjuvant chemotherapy was omitted among 46% of patients with complications, compared with 31% of patients with no complications (P < .0001). Having a complication was independently associated with omission of chemotherapy in multivariable analysis (adjusted OR, 1.76; 95% CI 1.59-1.95). Other factors significantly associated with chemotherapy omission were age, race, marital status, urgent/emergent admission, and type of operation. Risk ratios increase with multiple complications (P < .0001). Complications were also associated with an increased risk of chemotherapy delay (P < .0001).Surgical complications are independently associated with omission of chemotherapy for stage III colorectal cancer and with a delay in adjuvant chemotherapy. These data suggest that complications of colorectal surgery may affect both short- and long-term cancer outcomes. Thus, the implementation of quality improvement measures that effectively reduce perioperative complications may also provide a long-term cancer survival benefit.');

These measurements were taken at baseline through 12 months post-surgery and drug administration.Patients treated with SDD and surgery demonstrated stronger reductions in PD in surgically-treated sites of >or=7 mm as well as gains in CAL (p<0.004). Furthermore, SDD+surgery resulted in short-term reductions in ICTP levels compared with placebo. Rebounds in ICTP levels and clinical parameters occurred when SDD was withdrawn.The results from this multi-centre study suggests that SDD in combination with surgery improves the short-term response of periodontal therapy by reducing PD, increasing CAL gain and inhibiting early stage bone resorption.');

Current evidence indicates that lupus flares when genetically predisposed individuals encounter environmental agents that trigger the disease, and that the environmental contribution is mediated at least in part by T cell DNA demethylation. We hypothesized that lupus disease activity is directly related to total genetic risk and inversely related to T cell DNA methylation levels in each patient. Since women are predisposed to lupus in part because of their second X chromosome, we also hypothesized that men would require a greater genetic risk, a greater degree of autosomal T cell DNA demethylation, or both, to achieve a lupus flare equal in severity to women. Genetic risk was determined by genotyping men and women with lupus across 32 confirmed lupus susceptibility loci. The methylation status of two autosomal genes known to demethylate in T cells in proportion to disease activity, KIR2DL4 (KIR) and PRF1, was measured by bisulfite sequencing. Lupus disease activity was determined by the SLEDAI. Interactions between genetic score, T cell DNA demethylation, and the SLEDAI score were compared between the men and women by regression analysis. Combining the degree of DNA demethylation with the genetic risk score for each patient demonstrated that the (genetic risk)/(DNA methylation) ratio increased directly with disease activity in both men and women with lupus. Importantly, men required a greater (genetic risk)/(DNA methylation) ratio to achieve a SLEDAI score equivalent to women (P = 0.010 for KIR and P = 0.0054 for PRF1). This difference was not explained by a difference in the genetic risk or T cell DNA demethylation alone, suggesting a genetic-epigenetic interaction. These results suggest that genetic risk and T cell DNA demethylation interact in lupus patients to influence the severity of lupus flares, and that men require a higher genetic risk and/or greater degree of T cell DNA demethylation to achieve a lupus flare equal in severity to women.');

These disruptions may stem from LH excess, abnormal FSH input, compromised ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropins, or intrinsic ovarian defects. To determine if exogenous gonadotropins rescue ovarian and ovulatory function of testosterone-treated sheep, the release of endogenous LH and biopotent FSH in control and prenatal testosterone-treated sheep was blocked with a GnRH antagonist during the first two breeding seasons and with LH/FSH coadministered in a manner approximating natural follicular phase. An acidic mix of FSH was administered the first 36 h at 2-h intervals and a less acidic mix for the next 12 h at 1-h intervals (different FSH preparations were used each year), and ovulation was induced with hCG. Circulating FSH and estradiol responses to gonadotropins measured in 2-h samples differed between treatment groups in Year 1 but not in Year 2. Ovarian follicular distribution and number of corpora lutea (in ewes that ovulated) tracked by ultrasonography and luteal progesterone responses were similar between control and prenatal testosterone-treated females but differed between years. Furthermore, hCG administration induced large cystic and luteinized follicles in both groups of females in Year 2, although the growth rate differed between control and prenatal testosterone-treated females. Our findings provide evidence that 1) ovulatory response in prenatal testosterone-treated females can be rescued with exogenous gonadotropins, 2) resultant follicular response is dependent on the nature of gonadotropic input, and 3) an abnormal follicular milieu may underlie differences in developmental trajectory of cystic follicles in prenatal testosterone-treated females.');

Deeper sequencing is required to adequately cover low-abundance transcripts. The array has been implemented in a multicenter clinical program and has generated high-quality, reproducible data. Considering the clinical trial requirements of cost, sample availability, and throughput, the GG-H array has a wide range of applications.

Here we report a dense set of genotypes from 94 inbred mouse strains containing 10.77 million genotypes over 121,433 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), dispersed at 20-kb intervals on average across the genome, with an average concordance of 99.94% with previous SNP sets. Through pairwise comparisons of the strains, we identified an average of 4.70 distinct segments over 73 classical inbred strains in each region of the genome, suggesting limited genetic diversity between the strains. Combining these data with genotypes of 7570 gap-filling SNPs, we further imputed the untyped or missing genotypes of 94 strains over 8.27 million Perlegen SNPs. The imputation accuracy among classical inbred strains is estimated at 99.7% for the genotypes imputed with high confidence.

Oral hygiene practices ceased for 21 days to induce gingivitis (induction), after which home care was reinstated until 35 days (resolution). Clinical parameters included plaque (PI) and gingival (GI) indices and papillary bleeding score (PBS). Levels and proportions of 40 subgingival bacteria were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Saliva was analyzed using a multiplex protein array for 30 biomarkers associated with host defense, inflammation, tissue destruction, and angiogenesis.Mean PI, GI, and PBS values were significantly increased during induction and decreased during resolution as measured at 35 days (P <0.01), although no differences were observed between IL-1 groups. Participants were stratified as either "high" or "low" responders based on inflammatory response (high: GI >1.5; low: GI â¤1.5).

Women with TN and DN tumors presented with larger, higher grade, and higher stage than women with OBC. Survival among women with TN tumors was poorer compared with that among women with OBC but was nearly the same as that of women with DN tumors. Results of the regression analysis indicated that disease stage, tumor grade, SES, and race/ethnicity were significant risk factors for survival.

In this article, we consider the use of S as an auxiliary variable and examine the information recovery from using S for estimating the treatment effect on T, when S is completely observed and T is partially observed. In an ideal but often unrealistic setting, when S satisfies Prentice''s definition for perfect surrogacy, there is the potential for substantial gain in precision by using data from S to estimate the treatment effect on T. When S is not close to a perfect surrogate, it can provide substantial information only under particular circumstances. We propose to use a targeted shrinkage regression approach that data-adaptively takes advantage of the potential efficiency gain yet avoids the need to make a strong surrogacy assumption. Simulations show that this approach strikes a balance between bias and efficiency gain. Compared with competing methods, it has better mean squared error properties and can achieve substantial efficiency gain, particularly in a common practical setting when S captures much but not all of the treatment effect and the sample size is relatively small.

Significantly decreased AChE activity was found in PD in striatum, cerebellum, and thalamus, with a marginally significant decrease in mesencephalon and no change in pons. Significantly greater declines in AChE activity in all subcortical regions were seen in MSA-P and PSP vs in PD. Decreased AChE activity in brainstem and cerebellum of all 3 disorders correlated with disturbances of balance and gait.Cerebral cortical cholinergic activity is decreased to a similar level in Parkinson disease (PD), parkinsonian syndromes of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) as compared to normal controls. Subcortical cholinergic activity is significantly more decreased in MSA-P and PSP than in PD. The more substantial decrease reflects greater impairment in the pontine cholinergic group, which is important in motor activity, particularly gait. These differences may account for the greater gait disturbances in the early stages of MSA-P and PSP than in PD.');

Of these men 364 (50%) completed the study protocol, including serum prostate specific antigen measurement, digital rectal examination, uroflowmetry and transrectal ultrasound. These men comprised our study group. Patients completed the American Urological Association (AUA) symptom and bothersomeness scores. Moderate to severe symptoms and impairment were defined as an AUA symptom score of greater than 7 and bothersomeness score of greater than 3, respectively. Data were stratified by 10-year age groups.Prostate volume increased, while the peak urinary flow rate decreased with increasing age (p <0.001). Total AUA symptom and bothersomeness scores were marginally associated with age (p = 0.08 and 0.01, respectively). Although only 8.2% of the men reported an enlarged prostate and 3% reported being on medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia, moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms were reported by 39.6% and moderate to severe impairment was present in 35%.To our knowledge this is the first study to describe the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms and its associations with age, prostate size and peak flow rate in a black American population. A large proportion of the men in this study had from moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms, of whom many were undiagnosed and untreated.

Omission of relevant factors may lead to overestimating the effects of neighborhoods on health while inclusion of time-varying confounders that may also be mediators (e.g., income, labor force status) may lead to underestimation. Using longitudinal data from the 1990 to 2007 years of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, this study investigates the link between neighborhood poverty and overall mortality risk. A marginal structural modeling strategy is employed to appropriately adjust for simultaneous mediating and confounding factors. To address the issue of possible upward bias from the omission of key variables, sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of results against unobserved confounding is conducted. We examine two continuous measures of neighborhood poverty - single-point and a running average. Both were specified as piece-wise linear splines with a knot at 20 percent. We found no evidence from the traditional naÃ¯ve strategy that neighborhood context influences mortality risk. In contrast, for both the single-point and running average neighborhood poverty specifications, the marginal structural model estimates indicated a statistically significant increase in mortality risk with increasing neighborhood poverty above the 20 percent threshold. For example, below 20 percent neighborhood poverty, no association was found. However, after the 20 percent poverty threshold is reached, each 10 percentage point increase in running average neighborhood poverty was found to increase the odds for mortality by 89 percent [95% CIÂ =Â 1.22, 2.91].

The main outcome measure was mortality at 5 years. Proportional hazards models were used to assess relationships between race and late mortality, accounting for patient factors, socioeconomic measures, and hospital factors. Fixed and random effects models were used to account for quality differences across hospitals.Black patients, compared with white patients, had lower 5-year overall survival rates after surgery for breast (62.1% v 70.4%, respectively; P < .001) and colon cancer (41.3% v 45.4%, respectively; P < .001).

Whether these studies are sufficiently powered to address common study objectives has not been adequately evaluated, and sample size estimates rarely account for the repeated nature of menstrual cycle data. Using data from the Tremin Trust (a study of menstrual function across the reproductive life span initiated in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1935 with data collected through 1977), the authors determined sampling strategies for assessing differences in mean cycle length between two exposure groups and for assessing change in mean cycle length across the reproductive life span. Following a larger number of women for 1-2 years is optimal for studies of host and environmental exposures that alter menstrual function. In contrast, following fewer women for an extended period of time, for example, 4-5 years, is optimal when studying how menstrual patterns vary across the reproductive life span in different populations.');

Several methods that use family-based controls have been proposed, including the haplotype relative risk, the transmission-disequilibrium test, and affected family-based controls. However, because these methods require genotypes on affected individuals and their parents, they are not ideally suited to the study of late-onset diseases. In this paper, we develop several family-based tests of association that use discordant sib pairs (DSPs) in which one sib is affected with a disease and the other sib is not. These tests are based on statistics that compare counts of alleles or genotypes or that test for symmetry in tables of alleles or genotypes. We describe the use of a permutation framework to assess the significance of these statistics. These DSP-based tests provide the same general advantages as parent-offspring trio-based tests, while being applicable to essentially any disease; they may also be tailored to particular hypotheses regarding the genetic model. We compare the statistical properties of our DSP-based tests by computer simulation and illustrate their use with an application to Alzheimer disease and the apolipoprotein E polymorphism.

Misclassification of half-sib pairs or unrelated individuals as full sibs can result in reduced power to detect linkage. When other family members, such as parents or additional siblings, are available, incorrectly specified relationships usually will be detected through apparent incompatibilities with Mendelian inheritance. Without other family members, sibling relationships cannot be determined absolutely, but they still can be inferred probabilistically if sufficient genetic marker data are available.

However, when genotypes for only one parent were available and the recombination rate was higher in females, the EMLOD using the sex-averaged map was inflated compared to the sex-specific map analysis if only mothers were genotyped and deflated if only fathers were genotyped. The inflation of the lod score when only mothers were genotyped led to markedly increased false-positive rates in some cases. The opposite was true when the recombination rate was higher in males; the EMLOD was inflated if only fathers were genotyped, and deflated if only mothers were genotyped.

Overall, our results from approaches designed to detect risk variants with relatively low frequency and high penetrance in a well-defined and relatively homogeneous population, provide strong empirical evidence supporting the notion that multiple genetic variants, including individually rare ones, that affect many different genes contribute to the genetic risk of familial schizophrenia. They also highlight differences in the genetic architecture of the familial and sporadic forms of the disease.');

Controversy exists, however, as to whether a cranial boost in addition to TBI is necessary to prevent central nervous system (CNS) recurrences in these high-risk cases. Previous national trials have included a cranial boost in the absence of data to justify its use. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess risk of CNS recurrence in ALL patients treated with TBI, to identify subsets of these high-risk patients at an increased or decreased risk of CNS recurrence after TBI, and to investigate whether regimens with higher doses of cranial irradiation further reduce the risk of CNS recurrence.Charts of 67 consecutively treated patients with ALL who received TBI before HSCT were reviewed. Data including patient demographics, clinical features at presentation, conditioning regimen, donor source, use of a cranial boost, remission stage at transplant, histologic subtype, cytogenetics, and extramedullary site of presentation were retrospectively collected and correlated with the risk of subsequent CNS recurrence.At the time of analysis, 30 (45%) patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 8 (12%) were alive with recurrence of leukemia, 7 (10.5%) had recurrent ALL but with successful salvage, 7 (11%) died subsequent to recurrence, 14 (21%) died from complications related to HCST, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up (1.5%). Of the patients who recurred after HSCT, the relapses were hematologic in 13 (57%), CNS with or without simultaneous marrow involvement in 3 (13%), and other sites in 7 (30%). Forty-one (61%) patients did not receive an extracranial boost of irradiation with TBI. Two of these patients (4.9%) suffered CNS failures compared with 1 of 26 (3.8%) who received a cranial boost (p = 0.84). None of the 40 patients who presented only with hematologic disease developed a CNS recurrence despite the fact that only 13 of 40 of these patients received a cranial boost after TBI. Cranial boost was therefore not associated with a reduction in CNS recurrence, especially in patients with only hematologic disease at presentation for which there were no failures regardless of the use of additional cranial radiotherapy.Patients who present with hematologic disease only at the time of HSCT have a low risk of CNS recurrence after TBI regardless of the use of a cranial boost, suggesting that a cranial boost may not be necessary in these patients.');

Ischemic stroke cases were prospectively ascertained in Nueces County, Texas. Home addresses were geocoded and used to establish the census tract for each stroke case. Census tracts were used as proxies for neighborhoods (n = 64). Using a standard definition, fast food restaurants were identified from a commercial list. Poisson regression was used to study the association between the number of fast food restaurants in the neighborhood, using a 1-mile buffer around each census tract, and the risk of stroke in the neighborhood. Models were adjusted for demographics and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES).There were 1,247 completed ischemic strokes from January 2000 through June 2003 and 262 fast food restaurants. The median number of fast food restaurants per census tract including buffer was 22 (interquartile range, 12-33). Adjusting for neighborhood demographics and SES, the association of fast food restaurants with stroke was significant (p = 0.02). The association suggested that the risk of stroke in a neighborhood increased by 1% for every fast food restaurant (relative risk, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.01). The relative risk of stroke comparing neighborhoods in the 75th to the 25th percentile of the distribution of fast food restaurants was 1.13 (95% CI, 1.02-1.25).Controlling for demographic and SES factors, there was a significant association between fast food restaurants and stroke risk in neighborhoods in this community-based study.');

Genetic studies can help dissect causal directions of epidemiological associations because genotypes are much less likely to be confounded, biased or influenced by disease processes. Using this Mendelian randomization principle, we selected a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near the SHBG gene, rs1799941, that is strongly associated with SHBG levels. We used data from this SNP, or closely correlated SNPs, in 27 657 type 2 diabetes patients and 58 481 controls from 15 studies. We then used data from additional studies to estimate the difference in SHBG levels between type 2 diabetes patients and controls. The SHBG SNP rs1799941 was associated with type 2 diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.97; P = 2 x 10(-5)], with the SHBG raising allele associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. This effect was very similar to that expected (OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.96), given the SHBG-SNP versus SHBG levels association (SHBG levels are 0.2 standard deviations higher per copy of the A allele) and the SHBG levels versus type 2 diabetes association (SHBG levels are 0.23 standard deviations lower in type 2 diabetic patients compared to controls). Results were very similar in men and women. There was no evidence that this variant is associated with diabetes-related intermediate traits, including several measures of insulin secretion and resistance. Our results, together with those from another recent genetic study, strengthen evidence that SHBG and sex hormones are involved in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes.');

In this paper, the authors 1) develop measures (scales) of neighborhood environment that are important in cardiovascular disease risk, 2) assess the psychometric and ecometric properties of these measures, and 3) examine individual- and neighborhood-level predictors of these measures. In 2004, data on neighborhood conditions were collected from a telephone survey of 5,988 residents at three US study sites (Baltimore, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and New York, New York). Information collected covered seven dimensions of neighborhood environment (aesthetic quality, walking environment, availability of healthy foods, safety, violence, social cohesion, and activities with neighbors). Neighborhoods were defined as census tracts or census clusters. Cronbach''s alpha coefficient ranged from 0.73 to 0.83, with test-retest reliabilities of 0.60-0.88. Intraneighborhood correlations were 0.28-0.51, and neighborhood reliabilities were 0.64-0.78 for census tracts for most scales.

At the run-in visits, measurements were conducted at rest, at a standardised time near end-exercise (isotime) and at peak exercise during constant work rate (CWR) cycle tests at 75% of each individual''s maximum work capacity. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the test-retest repeatability of measurements of endurance time (ET), inspiratory capacity (IC), ventilation and dyspnoea intensity (Borg scale) during exercise. IC, ventilation and dyspnoea ratings were normally distributed; ET showed rightward skew (median<mean, skewness of 10.9 (much greater than zero)) with 16% of the sample exceeding 1 SD of the mean. ET was highly repeatable across run-in visits: 7.9+/-4.8 and 8.4+/-5.1 min (R = 0.84). IC values at rest, isotime and peak exercise were all highly repeatable (R > or = 0.87). Ventilation was repeatable over the same time-points (R > or = 0.92), as was dyspnoea intensity at isotime (R = 0.79) and at peak exercise (R = 0.81).

Baseline FSH concentrations, subsequent FSH levels, and their interaction predicted 4-yr BMD loss. If baseline FSH was less than 25 mIU/ml, higher follow-up FSH (>70 mIU/ml) predicted a 4-yr spine BMD loss of -0.05 g/cm(2). If baseline FSH values were more than 35-45 mIU/ml, lower follow-up FSH (i.e. 40-50 mIU/ml) predicted a -0.05 g/cm(2) 4-yr spine BMD loss.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1373,2912068,'Having found evidence for segregation at a major locus for a quantitative trait, a logical next step is to identify those pedigrees in which major-locus segregation is occurring. If the quantitative trait is a risk factor for an associated disease, identifying such segregating pedigrees can be important in classifying families by etiology, in risk assessment, and in suggesting treatment modalities. Identifying segregating pedigrees can also be helpful in selecting pedigrees to include in a subsequent linkage study to map the major locus. Here, we describe a strategy to identify pedigrees segregating at a major locus for a quantitative trait. We apply this pedigree selection strategy to simulated data generated under a major-locus or mixed model with a rare dominant allele and sampled according to one of several fixed-structure or sequential sampling designs. We demonstrate that for the situations considered, the pedigree selection strategy is sensitive and specific and that a linkage study based only on the pedigrees classified as segregating extracts essentially all the linkage information in the entire sample of pedigrees. Our results suggest that for large-scale linkage studies involving many genetic markers, the savings from this strategy can be substantial and that, compared with fixed-structure sampling, sequential sampling of pedigrees can greatly improve the efficiency for linkage analysis of a quantitative trait.');

While the frequentist literature on this topic is vast, there is no Bayesian work in this general area. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper establishes Bayesian equivalence results that require characterization of the set of priors under which the posterior distributions of the risk ratio parameters based on a case-crossover and time-series analysis are identical. Second, the paper studies inferential issues under case-crossover designs in a Bayesian framework. Traditionally, a conditional logistic regression is used for inference on risk-ratio parameters in case-crossover studies. We consider instead a more general full likelihood-based approach which makes less restrictive assumptions on the risk functions. Formulation of a full likelihood leads to growth in the number of parameters proportional to the sample size. We propose a semi-parametric Bayesian approach using a Dirichlet process prior to handle the random nuisance parameters that appear in a full likelihood formulation. We carry out a simulation study to compare the Bayesian methods based on full and conditional likelihood with the standard frequentist approaches for case-crossover and time-series analysis.

Liver and spleen volumes were measured with computed tomography (CT) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Hepatic metabolism was assessed with caffeine and erythromycin, and hepatic blood flow (HBF) was assessed with cholates, galactose, and the perfused hepatic mass (PHM) by SPECT. The regeneration rates (mL kg(-1) of body weight day(-1)) by CT were 0.60Â±0.22 mL from the baseline to T1, 0.05Â±0.02 mL from T1 to T2, and 0.01Â±0.01 from T2 to T3; by SPECT they were 0.54Â±0.20, 0.04Â±0.01, and 0.01Â±0.02, respectively.

At T1, the unadjusted clearance ratios with respect to the baseline were 0.75Â±0.07 for intravenous cholate (P<0.001), 0.88Â±0.15 for galactose (P=0.07), 0.84Â±0.08 for PHM (P=0.002), and 0.83Â±0.19 for the estimated HBF (P=0.06). At T1, these ratios adjusted per liter of liver were up to 50% greater than the baseline values, suggesting recruitment of HBF by the regenerating liver. Increased cholate shunt, increased spleen volume, and decreased platelet count, were consistent with an altered portal circulation.

Further investigation of an interval might include typing other available families or family members, typing additional markers in the interval, and carrying out further statistical analyses. This strategy is efficient in the number of genotypings required and focuses attention on regions most likely to harbor a disease gene with a substantial impact on disease risk, while resulting in the pursuit of a manageable number of false-positive linkage results.

Seven of the malignant PT were low grade, and six were high grade. Ki-67 and p53 immunohistochemistry was performed on all tumors and analyzed for the stromal and for the epithelial component. PCR-based loss of heterozygosity analyses were performed with the following markers on Chromosome 3p: D3S1478 (3p21.2--21.3), D3S1289 (3p21.1--21.2), and D3S1295 (3p14.3--21.1). The distribution of immunoreactivity for Ki-67 was analyzed by quantifying the percentage of positive nuclei and expressed as the labeling index (LI). Patients'' ages ranged from 13 to 71 years (median: 51 y). After a mean follow-up period of 8 years, none of the PT metastasized, whereas three recurred locally. Although malignant PT were larger than benign PT (means, 7.1 versus 4.3 cm), this difference was not statistically significant. Five tumors had infiltrating margins, and 14 were circumscribed. The Ki-67 LI in low-grade malignant PT (16 +/- 25.5) was significantly higher than that in benign PT (3.6 +/- 4.8), whereas the LI in the high-grade malignant PT group (50 +/- 21.9) was significantly higher than that in low-grade malignant tumors (P =.012). The Ki-67 LI in the three tumors that recurred was less than 10%. Two of seven (29%) benign PT were focally positive for p53, whereas four of seven (57%) low-grade malignant and three of six (50%) high-grade malignant PT were diffusely positive for p53. The three tumors that recurred initially were histologically benign, as were two of the recurrences. One recurrent tumor evolved to a high-grade malignant PT. Margins were greater than 1 cm in all tumors except four, three of which recurred locally. No allelic loss of 3p was found. In summary, Ki-67 expression may assist in distinguishing benign from malignant PT in diagnostically difficult cases. 3p deletions do not play a significant role in the development of these tumors. Neither Ki-67 nor p53 can reliably predict recurrence. Histologically high-grade malignant PT have a favorable prognosis if widely excised.

Computerized dosimetry was used to deliver total doses of 50 Gy in 5-1/2 weeks to the chest wall and the internal mammary lymph nodes with electron arc therapy. Patients were assessed for local, regional, and distant control of disease and for survival. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazards were modeled using a hierarchical nonproportional semiparametric model testing the following prognostic factors: age, stage, tumor size, number of positive lymph nodes, estrogen receptor status, and dose. End points evaluated included disease-free survival, cause-specific survival, and overall survival.Eighty-one percent of patients were at high risk for local-regional failure because of > T2 primary tumor or > 3 positive axillary lymph nodes.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1387,2184092,'Commingling analysis is commonly used to provide preliminary evidence for a single genetic locus with a major effect on the quantitative trait of interest. In this paper, the effectiveness of commingling analysis as a screening technique to identify samples for segregation analysis is assessed by applying both commingling and segregation analyses to samples of simulated pedigree data in which a major locus is segregating in the presence of polygenes and an individual-specific environmental effect. Under the circumstances simulated here, there is evidence for a single locus from segregation analysis but not from commingling analysis in at least 20% of the samples. No more than 2% of the samples provided evidence for commingling but not for segregation of a single locus. Comparisons of the samples that give evidence for both commingling and segregation, evidence for one but not the other, and no evidence for either show that evidence for commingling depends on the distributional characteristics of the trait in the sample, while support for the single locus from segregation analysis depends on both the distributional characteristics as well as the transmission of the rarer allele from parents to offspring. Since lack of commingling does not rule out the existence of a single locus in the realistic situations considered here, commingling analysis has limited usefulness as a screening technique for the presence for a single locus. In contrast, evidence for commingling does suggest the possibility that a single locus has a major effect on the trait and commingling analysis can provide guidance in the choice of initial parameter estimates for segregation analysis.');

The dimensions of reductions in the T4 (T helper-inducer cells) subpopulation of lymphoid cells in the T4-T8 ratio were found to correlate most closely with prognosis. Most other immunological changes did not relate to clinical course. T4 lymphocyte levels greater than 300/microL and a T4-T8 ratio greater than 0.5 indicated a relatively good prognosis, eg, 85% to 95% survival at 12 months. T4 levels less than 100/microL and/or a T4-T8 ratio less than 0.2 had a very poor prognosis, eg, less than 25% survival at 12 months. Intermediate T4 levels and T4-T8 ratios had intermediate prognosis. These immunological findings were found to have independent prognostic value for survival when compared with disease classifications based on tumor stage (I through IV) or on clinical status A (without) or B (with fever, night sweats, or weight loss). Reduced proliferative capacity, increased OKT10 antigen expression, elevated levels of serum IgA, and immune complexes also correlated with prognosis. Elevated levels of serum IgG, cellular HLA-DR expression, and skin test anergy occurred frequently in AIDS-KS but did not have prognostic significance.

Information on usual pretreatment food and nutrient intake was estimated via food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) on 49 HNC cases. Tumor DNA methylation patterns were assessed using the Illumina Goldengate Methylation Cancer Panel. First, a methylation score, the sum of individual hypermethylated tumor suppressor associated CpG sites, was calculated and associated with dietary intake of micronutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism and antioxidant activity, and food groups abundant in these nutrients. Second, gene specific analyses using linear modeling with empirical Bayesian variance estimation were conducted to identify if methylation at individual CpG sites was associated with diet. All models were controlled for age, sex, smoking, alcohol and HPV status. Individuals reporting in the highest quartile of folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A intake, compared with those in the lowest quartile, showed significantly less tumor suppressor gene methylation, as did patients reporting the highest cruciferous vegetable intake. Gene specific analyses identified differential associations between DNA methylation and vitamin B12 and vitamin A intake when stratifying by HPV status.

Subcutaneous 9L gliosarcomas were treated with a single dose of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. Both sodium and diffusion imaging modalities were able to detect changes in tumor cellularity as early as 2 days after treatment, which continued to evolve as increased signal intensities reached a maximum approximately 8 days posttreatment. Early changes in tumor sodium and apparent diffusion coefficient values were predictive of subsequent tumor shrinkage, which occurred approximately 10 days later. Overall, therapeutical induced changes in sodium and diffusion values were found to have similar dynamic and spatial changes. These findings suggest that these imaging modalities detected similar early cellular changes after treatment.

This haplotype was very similar to other risk haplotypes for at least 60 kb telomeric to HLA-C, suggesting identity by descent with the remaining risk chromosomes. The association, however, between psoriasis and this haplotype as assessed by the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) was of borderline significance (p-value 0.048).

The new sample included 1275 pedigrees as well as 300 cases and 913 controls. Transmission of this allele to affected individuals was examined using the TDT and the pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT), and case-control samples were analyzed by a trend test across genotype categories. By all methods, the newly acquired genotypes failed to confirm the association originally reported, despite adequate power. In contrast, the 248 bp allele, which is found on all HLA-Cw6-positive risk haplotypes as well as several non-risk haplotypes, shows significant excess transmission for all cohorts.

Many general methods have been suggested, which aim to remove the effects of confounding from gene expression data. However, the residual confounding which is not accounted for by these generic correction procedures has the potential to induce correlation between genes. Therefore, a method that specifically aims to calculate gene coexpression between gene expression arrays, while accounting for confounding effects, is desirable.In this article, we present a statistical model for calculating gene coexpression called mixed model coexpression (MMC), which models coexpression within a mixed model framework. Confounding effects are expected to be encoded in the matrix representing the correlation between arrays, the inter-sample correlation matrix. By conditioning on the information in the inter-sample correlation matrix, MMC is able to produce gene coexpressions that are not influenced by global confounding effects and thus significantly reduce the number of spurious coexpressions observed. We applied MMC to both human and yeast datasets and show it is better able to effectively prioritize strong coexpressions when compared to a traditional Pearson''s correlation and a Pearson''s correlation applied to data corrected with surrogate variable analysis (SVA).The method is implemented in the R programming language and may be found at http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/mmc.nfurlott@cs.ucla.edu; eeskin@cs.ucla.edu.');

Two of their rules compare estimates from fully imputed data where the imputations are based on a subset of early responders to fully imputed data where the imputations are based on the combined set of early and late responders. If these two estimates are different, then late responders are changing the estimate of interest. The present article develops a new rule for when to stop collecting data in a sample survey. The rule attempts to use complete interview data as well as covariates available on non-responders to determine when the probability that collecting additional data will change the survey estimate is sufficiently low to justify stopping data collection. The rule is compared with that of RGG using simulations and then is implemented using data from a real survey.');

To test these concepts in humans, we analyzed urine pellet mRNAs from 358 adult and pediatric kidney clinic patients and 291 controls (n=1143 samples). Compared with controls, urine podocyte mRNAs increased 79-fold (P<0.001) in patients with biopsy-proven glomerular disease and a 50% decrease in kidney function or progression to ESRD. An independent cohort of patients with Alport syndrome had a 23-fold increase in urinary podocyte mRNAs (P<0.001 compared with controls). Urinary podocyte mRNAs increased during active disease but returned to baseline on disease remission. Furthermore, urine podocyte mRNAs increased in all categories of glomerular disease evaluated, but levels ranged from high to normal, consistent with individual patient variability in the risk for progression. In contrast, urine podocyte mRNAs did not increase in polycystic kidney disease. The association between proteinuria and podocyturia varied markedly by glomerular disease type: a high correlation in minimal-change disease and a low correlation in membranous nephropathy. These data support the podocyte depletion hypothesis as the mechanism driving progression in all human glomerular diseases, suggest that urine pellet podocyte mRNAs could be useful for monitoring risk for progression and response to treatment, and provide novel insights into glomerular disease pathophysiology.');

GVHD mortality, morbidity, and pathologic and biochemical indices were all worse in old recipients. Donor T cell responses were significantly increased in old recipients both in vivo and in vitro when stimulated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from old mice, which also secreted more TNF-alpha and IL-12 after LPS stimulation. In a B6 --> B6D2F1 model, CD4(+) donor T cells but not CD8(+) T cells mediated more severe GVHD in old mice. We confirmed the role of aged APCs in GVHD using B6D2F1 BM chimeras created with either old or young BM. Four months after chimera creation, allogeneic BMT from B6 donors caused significantly worse GVHD in old BM chimeras. APCs from these mice also stimulated greater responses from allogeneic cells in vitro. These data demonstrate a hitherto unsuspected mechanism of amplified donor T cell responses by aged allogeneic host APCs that increases acute GVHD in aged recipients in this BMT model.');

A simple and convenient approach to analysis is to develop summary measures for each individual and then regress the summary measures on between-subject covariates. We examine properties of this approach in the context of the linear mixed effects model when the data are not missing completely at random, in the sense that drop-out depends on the values of the repeated measures after conditioning on fixed covariates. The approach is compared with likelihood-based approaches that model the vector of repeated measures for each individual. Methods are compared by simulation for the case where repeated measures over time are linear and can be summarized by a slope and intercept for each individual. Our simulations suggest that summary measures analysis based on the slopes alone is comparable to full maximum likelihood when the data are missing completely at random but is markedly inferior when the data are not missing completely at random.

Bacterial community diversity decreased significantly over time in patients with typically progressive lung disease but remained relatively stable in patients with a mild lung disease phenotype. Antibiotic use, rather than patient age or lung function, was the primary driver of decreasing diversity. Interpatient variability in community structure exceeded intrapatient variability in serial samples. Antibiotic treatment was associated with pronounced shifts in community structure, but communities showed both short- and long-term resilience after antibiotic perturbation. There was a positive correlation between OTU occurrence and relative abundance, with a small number of persistent OTUs accounting for the greatest abundance. Significant changes in community structure, diversity, or total bacterial density at the time of pulmonary exacerbation were not observed. Despite decreasing community diversity in patients with progressive disease, total bacterial density remained relatively stable over time.

Genetic model fitting was performed on 2658 unselected sibships, which provided evidence for a single common familial factor that accounted for a substantial proportion of the genetic variances and covariances of the four scales. Using the parameter estimates from this model, a composite index of liability (G) was constructed.

With the invocation of hidden Markov models, we propose a new measure of pairwise dependency based on transition probabilities. The new dynamic interaction measure checks whether or not the joint transition kernel of the bivariate state variables is the product of two marginal transition kernels. This new measure enables us not only to evaluate the strength, but also to infer the details of gene dependencies. It reveals nonlinear combinatorial dependency structure in two aspects: between two genes and across adjacent time points.

In an effort to identify the PSORS1 gene, we cloned and completely sequenced this region from both chromosomes of five individuals. Two of the sequenced haplotypes were associated with psoriasis (risk), and the other eight were clearly unassociated (nonrisk). Comparison of sequence of the two risk haplotypes identified a 298-kb region of homology, extending from just telomeric of HLA-B to the HCG22 gene, which was flanked by clearly nonhomologous regions. Similar haplotypes cloned from unrelated individuals had nearly identical sequence. Combinatorial analysis of exonic variations in the known genes of the candidate interval revealed that HCG27, PSORS1C3, OTF3, TCF19, HCR, STG, and HCG22 bore no alleles unique to risk haplotypes among the 10 sequenced haplotypes. SPR1 and SEEK1 both had messenger RNA alleles specific to risk haplotypes, but only HLA-C and CDSN yielded protein alleles unique to risk. The risk alleles of HLA-C and CDSN (HLA-Cw6 and CDSN*TTC) were genotyped in 678 families with early-onset psoriasis; 620 of these families were also typed for 34 microsatellite markers spanning the PSORS1 interval. Recombinant haplotypes retaining HLA-Cw6 but lacking CDSN*TTC were significantly associated with psoriasis, whereas recombinants retaining CDSN*TTC but lacking HLA-Cw6 were not associated, despite good statistical power. By grouping recombinants with similar breakpoints, the most telomeric quarter of the 298-kb candidate interval could be excluded with high confidence.

We also summarize results of bivariate analyses for all pairs of traits and of heterogeneity analyses for each trait. We found a significant genetic component for every trait. On average, genetic effects explained 40% of the variance for 38 blood tests, 51% for five anthropometric measures, 25% for 20 measures of cardiovascular function, and 19% for 35 personality traits. Four traits showed significant evidence for an X-linked component. Bivariate analyses suggested overlapping genetic determinants for many traits, including multiple personality facets and several traits related to the metabolic syndrome; but we found no evidence for shared genetic determinants that might underlie the reported association of some personality traits and cardiovascular risk factors. Models allowing for heterogeneity suggested that, in this cohort, the genetic variance was typically larger in females and in younger individuals, but interesting exceptions were observed. For example, narrow heritability of blood pressure was approximately 26% in individuals more than 42 y old, but only approximately 8% in younger individuals. Despite the heterogeneity in effect sizes, the same loci appear to contribute to variance in young and old, and in males and females. In summary, we find significant evidence for heritability of many medically important traits, including cardiovascular function and personality. Evidence for heterogeneity by age and sex suggests that models allowing for these differences will be important in mapping quantitative traits.');

Psychosocial maturation is the process of adopting adult roles, attitudes and behaviors and completing developmental tasks associated with becoming an adult. Past research has demonstrated that individuals'' participation in health-risk behaviors decreases as psychosocial maturity increases. Not surprisingly, decreases in driving risk that occur over the first years of driving have often been assumed to result in large degree from general maturation; however, no research has tested this assumption. This study used data from a telephone survey of young adults to begin addressing this gap in the literature by testing three hypotheses: (1) indicators of higher psychosocial maturity are associated with lower problem driving behavior; (2) the association between the level of psychosocial maturity and problem driving behavior is cumulative; and, (3) these associations are moderated by sex. Problem driving behavior was evaluated by assessing three measures: high-risk driving, drink/driving, and drug/driving. Results supported all three hypotheses. Participants with greater psychosocial maturity had lower levels of problem driving behavior than participants who were less psychosocially mature. Second, problem driving behavior was lower with higher psychosocial maturity. Third, these associations between psychosocial maturity and problem driving behavior were moderated by sex.

In many well-studied candidate genes and for standard dietary and behavioral epidemiologic exposures, there is often substantial prior information available that may be used to analyze current data as well as for designing a new study. In this article, first, we propose a proper full Bayesian approach for analyzing studies of gene-environment interaction. The Bayesian approach provides a natural way to incorporate uncertainties around the assumption of gene-environment independence, often used in such an analysis. We then consider Bayesian sample size determination criteria for both estimation and hypothesis testing regarding the multiplicative gene-environment interaction parameter. We illustrate our proposed methods using data from a large ongoing case-control study of colorectal cancer investigating the interaction of N-acetyl transferase type 2 (NAT2) with smoking and red meat consumption. We use the existing data to elicit a design prior and show how to use this information in allocating cases and controls in planning a future study that investigates the same interaction parameters. The Bayesian design and analysis strategies are compared with their corresponding frequentist counterparts.');

Suggestive evidence for linkage was observed in two single bins, on chromosomes 5q (142-168 Mb) and 2q (103-134 Mb). Genome-wide evidence for linkage was detected on chromosome 2q (119-152 Mb) when bin boundaries were shifted to the middle of the previous bins. The primary analysis met empirical criteria for ''aggregate'' genome-wide significance, indicating that some or all of 10 bins are likely to contain loci linked to SCZ, including regions of chromosomes 1, 2q, 3q, 4q, 5q, 8p and 10q. In a secondary analysis of 22 studies of European-ancestry samples, suggestive evidence for linkage was observed on chromosome 8p (16-33 Mb). Although the newer genome-wide association methodology has greater power to detect weak associations to single common DNA sequence variants, linkage analysis can detect diverse genetic effects that segregate in families, including multiple rare variants within one locus or several weakly associated loci in the same region.

Logistic regressions were used to investigate associations between diuretic use and patient characteristics. Outcomes of interdialytic weight gain, increased serum potassium and phosphorus levels, and odds of retaining RRF after 1 year were investigated. Cox regression was used to analyze the association between mortality and diuretic use.Facility diuretic use varied substantially from 0% to 83.9% of patients. Diuretic use decreased sharply after the start of dialysis therapy. Loop diuretic use ranged from 9.2% in the United States to 21.3% in Europe, whereas use within 90 days of starting dialysis therapy ranged from 25.0% in the United States to 47.6% in Japan. Diuretic use was associated with lower interdialytic weight gain and lower odds of hyperkalemia (potassium > 6.0 mmol/L).

Multiple imputation is used as a strategy for handling missing values arising from censoring. The imputation procedure uses a cure model for time to recurrence and a time-dependent Weibull proportional hazards model for time to death. Recurrence times are imputed, and then death times are imputed conditionally on recurrence times. To illustrate these methods, trials are artificially censored 2 years after the last accrual, the imputation procedure implemented, and a log-rank test and Cox model used to analyze and compare these new data with the original data.The results show modest, but consistent gains in efficiency in the analysis using the auxiliary information in recurrence times. Comparison of analyses show the treatment effect estimates and log-rank test results from the 2-year censored imputed data to be in between the estimates from the original data and the artificially censored data, indicating that the procedure was able to recover some of the lost information due to censoring.The models used are all fully parametric, requiring distributional assumptions of the data.The proposed models may be useful in improving the efficiency in estimation of treatment effects in cancer trials and shortening trial length.');

This approach has several advantages. First, moderately strong signals from different SNPs are combined to obtain a much stronger signal for the set, therefore increasing power. Second, in combination with methods that provide information on untyped markers, it leads to results that can be readily combined across studies and platforms that might use different SNPs. Third, the results are easy to interpret, since they refer to functional sets of markers that are likely to behave as a unit in their phenotypic effect. Finally, the availability of gene-level P-values for association is the first step in developing methods that integrate information from pathways and networks with genome-wide association data, and these can lead to a better understanding of the complex traits genetic architecture.

Recently developed mRNA sequencing technology presents an unprecedented opportunity to discover new forms of transcripts, and at the same time brings bioinformatic challenges due to its short read length and incomplete coverage for the transcripts. In this work, we proposed a computational approach to reconstruct new mRNA transcripts from short sequencing reads with reference information of known transcripts in existing databases. The prior knowledge helped to define exon boundaries and fill in the transcript regions not covered by sequencing data. This approach was demonstrated using a deep sequencing data set of human muscle tissue with transcript annotations in RefSeq as prior knowledge. We identified 2,973 junctions, 7,471 exons, and 7,571 transcripts not previously annotated in RefSeq. 73% of these new transcripts found supports from UCSC Known Genes, Ensembl or EST transcript annotations. In addition, the reconstructed transcripts were much longer than those from de novo approaches that assume no prior knowledge. These previously un-annotated transcripts can be integrated with known transcript annotations to improve both the design of microarrays and the follow-up analyses of isoform expression.

Number of involved nodes and extracapsular invasion were found significant and independent prognostic factors. High risk (50%) of DM and death due to DM correlate with age < 40 y, premenopausal status, tumor stage > or = T3, more than 2 axillary nodes and/or extracapsular invasion. The linearity of the curves for freedom from DM and for freedom from death due to the DM suggest uniform distribution of progression rates with a median value for halving time for freedom from early DM of about 8 months, and of about 40 months for freedom from the DM occurring later than 18 months, being for whole group an average of 20 months. High incidence of DM is a significant cause of poor long-term survival. Early appearance (< 18 month follow-up) of about half of the DM suggests that they are already present as subclinical micrometastases at the time of initial loco-regional treatment. The time of appearance of distant metastases is consistent with a wide range of metastatic cell burdens among patients.

I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., Wilmington, Del.), and Genetic Systems (GS; Genetic Systems, Seattle, Wash.) kits, respectively. Evaluation was based on the distribution of quantitative test results (such as optical densities), a comparison with Western blot (WB) results, reproducibility of the tests, and identification of seroconverters. The performances of the GS and the DP kits were good by all four criteria and exceeded that of the LT kit. Primary ELISA-negative results were not always confirmed with repeat ELISA and by WB testing. The largest percentage of these unconfirmed negative test results came from samples with quantitative results in the fifth percentile nearest the cutoff. Thus, supplementary testing was indicated for samples with test results in this borderline negative range. Similarly, borderline positive primary ELISA results that were quantitatively nearest (fifth percentile) the cutoff value were more likely to be antibody negative on supplementary testing than samples with high antibody values. In this study, results of repeated tests by GS ELISA showed the least change from first test results. DP ELISA showed more unconfirmed primary positive test results, and LT ELISA showed more unconfirmed primary negative test results. Designation of a specimen with a single ELISA quantitative level near the cutoff value as positive or negative should be viewed with skepticism. A higher than normal proportion of specimens with high negative optical densities by GS ELISA (fifth percentile nearest the cutoff) and also negative by WB were found to be from individuals in the process of seroconversion.');

This phase II trial assessed the efficacy, safety, and responses in 16 patients, 10 related and 6 URD transplants after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen and stem cell transplant as a treatment for metastatic RCC. Sixteen patients received a conditioning consisting of either fludarabine, cyclophosphamide (n=11) or fludarabine, total body irradiation (n=5) followed by transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling donor or a unrelated HLA-donor. Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil were administered as posttransplant immunosuppression. Patients were monitored for engraftment by short tandem repeat for myeloid and lymphoid lineages and clinical response was assessed by serial imaging. All patients achieved donor chimerism, 7 patients developed acute, grades 2 to 3, graft-versus-host disease. Chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in 6 patients and transplant-related mortality was 12%. Of the 10 related donors, 1 obtained a complete response, 3 had a partial response, and 3 had stable disease.

Massive transfusion (MT, â¥10 red blood cells [RBCs] and/or whole blood in 24 hours) and volume/ratios of plasma/RBC, platelet/RBC, and crystalloid/RBC (C/RBC, crystalloid liters/RBC units) were examined using bivariate/multivariate logistic regression and local regression analyses as ARDS risk factors, controlling for age, injury severity, admission systolic blood pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score.ARDS was identified in 95 cases (6.4%). MT was required in 550 (37.3%) of the analysis cohort. ARDS was more common in MT (46 of 550, 8.4%) versus no-MT cohort (49 of 925, 5.3%), but mortality was not different (17.4% MT vs. 16.3% no-MT). ARDS patients received significantly increased crystalloid of blood product volumes. Increased crystalloid resuscitation (C/RBC ratio > 1.5) occurred in 479 (32.7%) of 1,464 patients. Unadjusted mortality was significantly increased in the cohort with C/RBC ratio of 1.5 or less compared with those with greater than 1.5 (19.1% vs. 6.3%, p < 0.0001), but no difference in ARDS (6.5% vs. 6.6%) was identified.

Primary tumors were grouped into 4 sites, tongue (175), oral cavity including floor of mouth, faucial pillar, soft and hard palate and gingiva (210), tonsil (72) and buccal mucosa (41). Total doses of 60Co irradiation ranged from 30 Gy to 72 Gy, overall treatment times from 15 to 80 days and dose per fraction from 1.8 to 6 Gy. The large number of patients and diversity of dose fractionation patterns permitted assessment of the independent contributions to treatment outcome of stage, fraction size and overall treatment duration. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) Overall treatment time influenced strongly the probability of local tumor control. Over the interval of about 30-55 days used in treating most of this series of patients, an increase of 60 cGy per day, on average, was required for a constant control rate. (2) The increase in dose was attributed to accelerated tumor clonogen growth rate. Such accelerated growth could be a major determinant of failure in protracted regimens. (3) The accelerated rate of regrowth was similar for all tumor sites and stages. (4) The dose for tumor control was relatively independent of variations in fraction size within a range of about 1.6 Gy to 3 Gy: the alpha/beta value in the linear quadratic isoeffect equation was at least 15 Gy. (5) Local control at the primary site required an average of about 3 Gy more for each increase in T stage. This increase most likely reflected an increased number of tumor clonogens, not a decreased tumor cell radiosensitivity. (6) The probability of control at the primary site was less likely if lymph nodes were positive, but this association was only shown to be statistically significant for primaries classified here as oral cavity and oropharynx, not tonsil, tongue or buccal mucosa. (7) After allowing for differences in treatment parameters, especially for heterogeneity in overall treatment times, tumor control probability increased steeply with increase in total dose.

We therefore propose an alternative weighting matrix for the QIF, which asymptotically is an optimally weighted combination of the empirical covariance matrix and its model-based version, which is derived by minimizing its expected quadratic loss.

We describe a computationally efficient approach to testing association between SNPs and quantitative phenotypes, which can be applied to whole-genome association scans. In addition to observed genotypes, our approach allows estimation of missing genotypes, resulting in substantial increases in power when genotyping resources are limited. We estimate missing genotypes probabilistically using the Lander-Green or Elston-Stewart algorithms and combine high-resolution SNP genotypes for a subset of individuals in each pedigree with sparser marker data for the remaining individuals. We show that power is increased whenever phenotype information for ungenotyped individuals is included in analyses and that high-density genotyping of just three carefully selected individuals in a nuclear family can recover >90% of the information available if every individual were genotyped, for a fraction of the cost and experimental effort. To aid in study design, we evaluate the power of strategies that genotype different subsets of individuals in each pedigree and make recommendations about which individuals should be genotyped at a high density.

Unfortunately, there are many difficulties when using secondary data, especially since the states and transitions of published studies may not be consistent with the proposed multi-state model. Early approaches to reconciling published studies with the theoretical framework of a multi-state model have been limited to data available as cumulative counts of progression.

The study was carried out using data on 1,100 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. The patients were stratified by radiation dose (group 1: <67.5 Gy; group 2: 67.5-72.5 Gy; group 3: 72.5-77.5 Gy; group 4: 77.5-87.5 Gy) and prognosis category (favourable, intermediate and unfavourable as defined by pre-treatment PSA and Gleason score). A relapse was recorded when tumour recurrence was diagnosed or when three successive prostate specific antigen (PSA) elevations were observed from a post-treatment nadir PSA level. PSA relapse-free survival was used as the primary end point. The model, which is based on an iterated Yule process, is specified in terms of three parameters: the mean number of tumour clonogens that survive the treatment, the mean of the progression time of post-treatment tumour development and its standard deviation. The model parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The fact that the proposed model provides an excellent description both of the survivor function and of the hazard rate is prima facie evidence of the validity of the model because closeness of the two survivor functions (empirical and model-based) does not generally imply closeness of the corresponding hazard rates. The estimated cure probabilities for the favourable group are 0.80, 0.74 and 0.87 (for dose groups 1-3, respectively); for the intermediate group: 0.25, 0.51, 0.58 and 0.78 (for dose groups 1-4, respectively) and for the unfavourable group: 0.0, 0.27, 0.33 and 0.64 (for dose groups 1-4, respectively). The distribution of progression time to tumour relapse was found to be independent of prognosis group but dependent on dose. As the dose increases the mean progression time decreases (41, 28.5, 26.2 and 14.7 months for dose groups 1-4, respectively). This analysis confirms that, in terms of cure rate, dose escalation has a significant positive effect only in the intermediate and unfavourable groups. It was found that progression time is inversely proportional to dose, which means that patients recurring in higher dose groups have shorter recurrence times, yet these groups have better survival, particularly long-term. The explanation for this seemingly illogical observation lies in the fact that less aggressive tumours, potentially recurring after a long period of time, are cured by higher doses and do not contribute to the recurrence pattern. As a result, patients in higher dose groups are less likely to recur; however, if they do, they tend to recur earlier. The estimated hazard rates for prostate cancer pass through a clear-cut maximum, thus revealing a time period with especially high values of instantaneous cancer-specific risk; the estimates appear to be nonproportional across dose strata.');

Among women, age modified the ethnic associations with pre-stroke depression and fatalism but not optimism. Mexican American women had more optimism than non-Hispanic white women. With age, Mexican American women had less depression and fatalism, while non-Hispanic white women had more fatalism and similar depression. Among men, after adjustment for education and age, there was no ethnic association with fatalism, depression, and optimism.

Statistical analysis performed on data collected from more than 1000 experiments with phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides revealed that the oligo-probes, which form stable duplexes with RNA (DeltaG(o)37 < or = -30 kcal/mol) and have small self-interaction potential, are more frequently efficient than molecules that form less stable oligonucleotide-RNA hybrids or more stable self-structures. To achieve optimal statistical preference, the values for self-interaction should be (DeltaG(o)37) > or = -8 kcal/mol for inter-oligonucleotide pairing and (DeltaG(o)37) > or = -1.1 kcal/mol for intra-molecular pairing.

There were no grade 3 or 4 toxicities associated with the vaccines or major evidence of autoimmunity. Local accumulation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were found at the vaccination sites. There was a significant proliferative response of PBMCs to KLH induced by the vaccine. In 5 of 6 patients, the vaccine resulted in increased IFN-gamma production by PBMCs to KLH in an ELISPOT assay. Using the same assay, 3 of 7 patients'' PBMCs displayed increased IFN-gamma production in response to autologous tumor lysate.

Daily particulate matter less than 2.5microm in diameter (PM(2.5)), ozone (O(3)), and meteorological data were obtained from Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. To examine the association between PM(2.5) and stroke/TIA risk, we used Poisson regression. Separate models included same-day PM(2.5), PM(2.5) lagged 1 to 5 days, and an averaged lag effect.

Here we compare performances for seven processing methods using two data sets originally collected for disease profiling studies. An emphasis is placed on understanding sensitivity for detecting differentially expressed genes in terms of two key statistical determinants: test statistic variability for non-differentially expressed genes, and test statistic size for truly differentially expressed genes.In the two data sets considered here, up to seven-fold variation across the processing methods was found in the number of genes detected at a given false discovery rate (FDR). The best performing methods called up to 90% of the same genes differentially expressed, had less variable test statistics under randomization, and had a greater number of large test statistics in the experimental data. Poor performance of one method was directly tied to a tendency to produce highly variable test statistic values under randomization. Based on an overall measure of performance, two of the seven methods (Dchip and a trimmed mean approach) are superior in the two data sets considered here. Two other methods (MAS5 and GCRMA-EB) are inferior, while results for the other three methods are mixed.Choice of processing method has a major impact on differential expression analysis of microarray data.

Anatomic, susceptibility contrast, and continuous arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging were used to quantify the volume, blood volume, and blood flow of tumors orthotopically grown from these and wild-type 9L cells. Histologic, immunohistochemical, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses were also done on excised tumors. Finally, the effects of carmustine chemotherapy were also evaluated.Orthotopic tumors underexpressing VEGF-A had slower growth rates (increased median survival), greater blood flow, vessel density, and VEGF-D expression, but no statistical difference in blood volume and chemotherapeutic sensitivity, compared with tumors with wild-type levels of VEGF-A. Tumors overexpressing VEGF-A had faster growth rates, greater blood volume, vessel density, and blood flow but no statistical difference in VEGF-D expression and chemotherapeutic sensitivity compared with wild-type VEGF-A-expressing tumors.Blood volume and blood flow are independent and different biomarkers of tumor perfusion. Therefore, both should be measured when characterizing the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies. Underexpression of VEGF-A does not result in complete inhibition of angiogenesis. Moreover, these tumors have a different perfusion phenotype, suggesting that angiogenesis is mediated by an alternative pathway.

The effect of dose fractionation is relatively small, especially at the low doses characteristic of each treatment session in neutron radiotherapy. The alpha/beta values for the linear-quadratic survival curves range from 27 to 40 Gy. The curves for neutrons are different from the curves for gamma rays mainly in their alpha coefficients, as predicted by Kellerer and Rossi''s theory of dual radiation action, but both alpha and beta values are higher the lower the mean neutron energy, which is not consistent with the theory. The ratio of alpha coefficients reported here for various neutron beams to those for gamma rays reported elsewhere ranges between 3.2 and 4.6. This range of values represents the maximum limits for RBEn/gamma values (at very low doses), and is sometimes referred to as RBEm. These values increase with decreasing neutron energy. The ratios of beta coefficients for neutron and gamma-ray survival curves were lower than the alpha ratios, ranging between 0.9 and 1.9, although not reliably distinguished from 1.0. Each of a series of equal dose fractions given at 3-h intervals produced a constant (logarithmic) decrease in cell survival as evidenced by the consistency of the estimate of cell survival from a certain single dose fraction, regardless of the level of cell survival (number of dose fractions) from which the estimate was made. Even more significant than the overlap of individual data points is the excellent fit of all the data to survival curves reconstructed on the assumption of an equal effect per fraction.

Data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for all adult candidates wait-listed between March 1, 2002 and December 31, 2008 (n = 57,503) were analyzed. Status 1 candidates were excluded. Cox regression was used to model covariate-adjusted DDLT rates, which were stratified by the DSA, blood type, liver-intestine policy, and allocation MELD score. Inactive time on the wait list was not modeled, so the computed DDLT hazard ratios (HRs) were interpreted as active wait-list candidates. Many factors, including the candidate''s age, sex, diagnosis, hospitalization status, and height, prior DDLT, and combined listing for liver-kidney or liver-intestine transplantation, were significantly associated with DDLT rates. Factors associated with significantly lower covariate-adjusted DDLT rates were a higher serum creatinine level (HR = 0.92, P < 0.001), a higher bilirubin level (HR = 0.99, P = 0.001), and the receipt of dialysis (HR = 0.83, P < 0.001).

In conclusion, adjusted DDLT rates for actively listed candidates are affected by many factors aside from those integral to the allocation system; these factors include the components of the MELD score itself as well as candidate factors that were considered but were deliberately omitted from the MELD score in order to keep it objective. These results raise the question whether additional candidate characteristics should be explicitly incorporated into the prioritization of wait-list candidates because such factors are already systematically affecting DDLT rates under the current allocation system.');

Maximal IFN-gamma release occurred after T-cell culture with IL-12 and IL-18. Tumor-specific in vitro cytotoxicity was enhanced by IL-12, unaffected by addition of IL-18, and abrogated in perforin-deficient T cells irrespective of cytokine exposure.

Because of the long incubation period to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a vaccine trial with AIDS as the outcome would be a long and costly undertaking. Because contagiousness is concentrated into the period of primary infection, vaccine trials assessing contagiousness would not take as long. An approach to assessing vaccine effects on the contagiousness of primary infection while simultaneously assessing protection against infection is presented. It involves randomizing vaccination of couples in whom both individuals are uninfected and one or both have a risk of infection outside the couple. In such a study, the vaccine effect on susceptibility to infection can be estimated from the proportions of vaccinated and unvaccinated couples in whom neither partner is infected. Estimation of the contagiousness effect also uses information on the frequency with which both partners are infected.

Chapman-Hall, London, 1990), called generalized additive models, are applied to data from the patterns of fractionation study (Withers, H.R., Peters, L.J., Taylor, J.M.G., Owen, J.B., Morrison, W.H., Schultheiss, T.E., Keane, T., O''Sullivan, B., van Dyk, J., Gupta, N., Wang, C.C., Jones, C.U., Doppke, K.P., Myint, S., Thompson, M., Parsons, J.T., Mendenhall, W.M., Dische, S., Aird, E.G.A., Henk, J.M., Bidmead, M.A.M., Svoboda, V., Chon, Y., Hanlon, A.L., Peters, T.L. and Hanks, G.E.

These techniques enable one to develop models which more accurately represent the relationship between multivariate predictor variables and the outcome variable in a regression analysis. These data driven methods allow the effect of each predictor variable on the outcome to be non-linear and estimated from the data. This is achieved by replacing the standard linear model combination of predictor variables, such as ''alpha0 + alpha1dose + alpha2time'' by ''S1(dose) + S2(time)'', where S1 and S2 are smooth non-linear functions of dose and time, respectively, which are estimated from the data.In the pattern of fractionation study these methods indicate that the effect of total dose on the probability of local recurrence is linear, but there is a suggestion that the effect of overall treatment time is non-linear. There is no effect of dose and time on the latency time to recurrence of those who do recur, but there is a weak suggestion of a non-linear effect of patients age, with younger patients recurring earlier.Generalized additive models provide a flexible and powerful means of exploring non-linear effects in experimental data.');

Increasing fasting and 2-h plasma glucose levels were associated with increasing levels of several amino acids and decreasing levels of histidine and glutamine. Alanine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, and glutamine predicted incident type 2 diabetes in a 4.7-year follow-up of the METSIM Study, and their effects were largely mediated by insulin resistance (except for glutamine). We also found significant correlations between insulin sensitivity (Matsuda insulin sensitivity index) and mRNA expression of genes regulating amino acid degradation in 200 subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. Only 1 of 43 risk single nucleotide polymorphisms for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia, the glucose-increasing major C allele of rs780094 of GCKR, was significantly associated with decreased levels of alanine and isoleucine and elevated levels of glutamine.

Although newer therapeutic strategies are in constant development, therapeutic assessment has been hampered by the inability to assess, rapidly and quantitatively, efficacy in vivo. Diffusion imaging and, more recently, sodium MRI have demonstrated their distinct abilities to detect therapy-induced alterations in tumor cellularity, which has been demonstrated to be indicative of therapeutic efficacy. More importantly, both imaging modalities detect tumor response much earlier than traditional methodologies that rely on macroscopic volumetric changes. In this study, the correlation between tumor sodium and diffusion was further tested to demonstrate the sensitivity of sodium imaging to gauge tumor response to therapy by using a 9L rat gliosarcoma treated with varying doses of BCNU [1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea]. This orthotopic model has been demonstrated to display variability in response to BCNU therapy where initial insult has been shown to lead to drug-resistance. In brief, a single 26.6 mg/kg BCNU dose yielded dramatic responses in both diffusion and sodium MRI. However, a second equivalent BCNU dose yielded a much smaller change in diffusion and sodium, suggesting a drop in tumor sensitivity to BCNU. The MRI responses of animals treated with 13.3 mg/kg BCNU were much lower and similar responses were observed after the initial and secondary applications of BCNU. Furthermore, these results were further validated using volumetric measurements of the tumor and also ex vivo determination of tumor sensitivity to BCNU. Overall, these experiments demonstrate the sensitivity and applicability of sodium and diffusion MRI as tools for dynamic assessment of tumor response to therapy.');

This method is simpler than full maximum likelihood approaches, and yields consistent and asymptotically normally distributed estimator of the regression parameter when censoring is independent of the covariates. The estimator demonstrates very high relative efficiency in simulations. When compared with complete-case analysis, the proposed estimator can be more efficient when the missing data are missing completely at random and can correct bias when the missing data are missing at random.

Contrasts were selected to include emotion perception and emotion experience. Foci from individual studies were subjected to a voxelwise meta-analysis using multilevel kernel density analysis.For emotional experience, comparison subjects showed greater activation in the left occipital pole. For emotional perception, schizophrenia subjects showed reduced activation in bilateral amygdala, visual processing areas, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral frontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, and subcortical structures. Schizophrenia subjects showed greater activation in the cuneus, parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. Combining across studies and eliminating studies that did not balance on effort and stimulus complexity eliminated most differences in visual processing regions as well as most areas where schizophrenia subjects showed a greater signal. Reduced reactivity of the amygdala appeared primarily in implicit studies of emotion, whereas deficits in anterior cingulate cortex activity appeared throughout all contrasts.Processing emotional stimuli, schizophrenia patients show reduced activation in areas engaged by emotional stimuli, although in some conditions, schizophrenia patients exhibit increased activation in areas outside those traditionally associated with emotion, possibly representing compensatory processing.');

We tested whether this method can accurately estimate allele frequency differences between pools while maintaining the high-throughput nature of assay design, sample handling, and scoring. We follow up interesting allele frequency differences in pools by genotyping individuals.

Precision, as measured by the average standard deviation among 16 semidependent replicates, was 0.021 +/- 0.011 for the 16 SNPs and 0.018 +/- 0.008 for the 291381 SNPs used in further analysis.

We assume that each event time follows a gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters both modeled as functions of schedule and dose. A copula is assumed to obtain a bivariate distribution. To ensure an ethical trial, adaptive safety and efficacy acceptability conditions are imposed on the (schedule, dose) regimes. In stage 1 of the design, patients are randomized fairly among schedules and, within each schedule, a dose is chosen using a hybrid algorithm that either maximizes posterior mean utility or randomizes among acceptable doses. In stage 2, fair randomization among schedules is replaced by the hybrid algorithm. A modified version of this algorithm is used for nested schedules.

Violation of the multivariate normality assumption can occur if trait data are censored at some threshold value. Trait censoring can arise in a variety of ways, including assay limitation or confounding due to medication. Valid linkage analyses of censored data require the development of a modified VC method that directly models the censoring event. Here, we present such a model, which we call the "tobit VC method." Using simulation studies, we compare and contrast the performance of the traditional and tobit VC methods for linkage analysis of censored trait data. For the simulation settings that we considered, our results suggest that (1) analyses of censored data by using the traditional VC method lead to severe bias in parameter estimates and a modest increase in false-positive linkage findings, (2) analyses with the tobit VC method lead to unbiased parameter estimates and type I error rates that reflect nominal levels, and (3) the tobit VC method has a modest increase in linkage power as compared with the traditional VC method.

Initiated in October 2000 as a part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences'' Health Disparities Initiative, HEP is affiliated with the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center. The study is guided by a conceptual model that considers race-based residential segregation and associated concentrations of poverty and wealth to be fundamental factors influencing multiple, more proximate predictors of cardiovascular risk. Within this model, physical and social environments are identified as intermediate factors that mediate relationships between fundamental factors and more proximate factors such as physical activity and dietary practices that ultimately influence anthropomorphic and physiologic indicators of cardiovascular risk. The study design and data collection methods were jointly developed and implemented by a research team based in community-based organizations, health service organizations, and academic institutions. These efforts include collecting and analyzing airborne particulate matter over a 3-year period; census and administrative data; neighborhood observation checklist data to assess aspects of the physical and social environment; household survey data including information on perceived stressors, access to social support, and health-related behaviors; and anthropometric, biomarker, and self-report data as indicators of cardiovascular health. Through these collaborative efforts, HEP seeks to contribute to an understanding of factors that contribute to racial and socioeconomic health inequities, and develop a foundation for efforts to eliminate these disparities in Detroit.');

To avoid this, we propose a novel statistical method based on the optimal Sequence Kernel Association Test that allows us to test for rare variant effects using continuous phenotypes in the analysis of extreme phenotype samples.

We considered several modifications to the standard definition: to require PSA rises of a certain magnitude, to consider 2 instead of 3 rises, to require the final PSA value to be greater than a fixed cutoff level, and to define biochemical failure based on the slope of PSA over 1, 1.5, or 2 years. A clinically meaningful failure is defined as local recurrence, distant metastases, initiation of unplanned hormonal therapy, unplanned radical prostatectomy, or a PSA > 25 later than 6 months after radiation.Requiring the final PSA in a series of consecutive rises to be larger than 1.5 ng/mL increased the specificity of biochemical failure. For a fixed specificity, defining biochemical failure based on 2 consecutive rises, or the slope over the last year, could increase the sensitivity by up to approximately 20%, compared to the ASTRO definition. Using a rule based on the slope over the previous year or 2 rises leads to a slightly earlier detection of biochemical failure than does the ASTRO definition. Even with the best rule, only approximately 20% of true failures are biochemically detected more than 1 year before the clinically meaningful event time.There is potential for improvement in the ASTRO consensus definition of biochemical failure. Further research is needed, in studies with long follow-up times, to evaluate the relationship between various definitions of biochemical failure and true clinical outcome.');

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1569,14872409,'To fine map genes, investigators often test for disease-marker association in chromosomal regions with evidence for linkage. Given a marker allele tentatively associated with disease, one would ask if this allele, or one in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with it, could account in part for the observed linkage signal. This question can be addressed by determining if families selected on the basis of the presence of the tentatively associated allele show stronger evidence of linkage as measured by increased allele sharing identical by descent (IBD) by affected family members. However, common selection strategies can be biased for or against linkage in the marker region, even given no disease-marker association. We define unbiased selection schemes and extend the definition to allow weighted selection on the basis of all genotyped family members. For affected-sibship data, we describe three genotype-based weight variables, corresponding to dominant, recessive, and additive models. We then introduce a test for association of a family weight variable with excess IBD sharing. This test allows us to determine if the linkage signal in a region can be attributed in part to the presence of a marker allele, either because of direct involvement in disease etiology or because of LD with a predisposing genetic variant. For samples of 500 affected sib pairs, the tests are powerful in detection of genotype-IBD sharing association, even for disease models with sib relative risk as low as lambda S=1.1, or when evidence for linkage is absent because of sampling variation. This makes our method a new tool for detecting linkage as well as association, especially in regions harboring a candidate gene.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1577,17407198,'When treating cancer patients with radiation therapy, the normal tissue in an organ close to the tumour usually receives some dose of radiation. The dose is not of the same intensity throughout the organ. This radiation can cause normal tissue complications, so for treatment planning purposes, it is important to understand the relationship between the distribution of dose intensities in the organ and the occurrence of complications. One general summary measure of the dose effect is obtained by integrating a weighting function (w(d)) over the dose distribution. The weighting function w(d) should be monotone for biological reasons. Because the true shape of w(d) is not known, we estimate it non-parametrically subject to the monotonicity constraint. In our approach w(d) is written as a weighted sum of monotone basis functions. The weights in this sum are formulated as a mixture of point mass at zero and a Gamma random variable. A key feature of our method is that it allows for flat regions through the use of this mixture prior. The model is estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We illustrate our method with data from a head and neck cancer study in which the irradiation of the parotid gland results in loss of saliva flow.');

Inpatient claims for fractures were ascertained (2000-2004) and cross-referenced with strokes. Survival free from fracture (any and hip) poststroke was estimated and compared by ethnicity. Cox regression was used to test the association of ethnicity and fracture risk adjusted for confounders. Interaction terms for ethnicity and age were considered.The mean age was 71 years (SD, 13 yrs); 54% were Mexican American and 52% were women. The mean follow-up was 4 years. There were 105 fractures (33% of the hips). Survival free of any fracture and of hip fracture did not differ by ethnicity. Increasing age, female gender, intracerebral hemorrhage, and greater stroke severity were associated with risk of any fracture, but ethnicity was not. Ethnicity was associated with risk of hip fracture, but this association was modified by age (P = .02), where Mexican Americans were protected from hip fractures at younger but not older ages.Stroke patients were at high risk for fractures, with a 10% risk at 5 years.

This work hypothesizes that polymorphisms in key glutathione synthesizing enzyme, glutathione S-transferase, and selenoprotein genes underlie inter-individual differences in mercury body burden as assessed by analytical mercury measurement in urine and hair, biomarkers of elemental mercury and methylmercury, respectively. Urine and hair samples were collected from a population of dental professionals (n=515), and total mercury content was measured. Average urine (1.06Â±1.24 microg/L) and hair mercury levels (0.49Â±0.63 microg/g) were similar to national U.S. population averages. Taqman assays were used to genotype DNA from buccal swab samples at 15 polymorphic sites in genes implicated in mercury metabolism. Linear regression modeling assessed the ability of polymorphisms to modify the relationship between mercury biomarker levels and exposure sources (e.g., amalgams, fish consumption). Five polymorphisms were significantly associated with urine mercury levels (GSTT1 deletion), hair mercury levels (GSTP1-105, GSTP1-114, GSS 5''), or both (SEPP1 3''UTR).

Among those with HbA1c <8.0%, the incidence rate of progression was only 1.3 per 100 person-years, while it was 5.1, 4.2, and 6.7 per 100 person-years in the three other groups. We used generalized additive models to examine the dose-response curve using HbA1c as a continuous variable and found that the risk of progression rises steeply between an HbA1c of 7.5-8.5% and then remains approximately constant across higher levels. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that, in patients with microalbuminuria, the risk of progression to overt proteinuria can be reduced by improved glycemic control only if the HbA1c is maintained below 8.5%.

Compared to waiting for a lower-DRI organ, the lowest-MELD category recipients (MELD 6-8) who received high-DRI organs experienced significantly higher mortality (HR = 3.70; p < 0.0005). All recipients with MELD > or =20 had a significant survival benefit from transplantation, regardless of DRI. Transplantation of high-DRI organs is effective for high but not low-MELD candidates. Pairing of high-DRI livers with lower-MELD candidates fails to maximize survival benefit and may deny lifesaving organs to high-MELD candidates who are at high risk of death without transplantation.');

When risk factors vary more across space at a fixed moment in time than at a fixed location across time, cross-sectional studies will tend to give more precise estimates of risk factor effects and thus may be a better source of data for policy judgments.We conducted a diarrhoeal disease surveillance of 5616 individuals within 19 Ecuadorian villages. This data set was used to mimic cross-sectional and longitudinal studies by restricting focus to a single week and a single village, respectively. We compared the variability in risk factor effect estimates produced from each type of study.For household risk factors, the effect estimates produced by the longitudinal studies were more variable than their cross-sectional counterparts, which can be explained by greater spatial than temporal variability in the risk factor distribution. For example, the effect estimate of improved sanitation was almost twice as variable in longitudinal studies.In our study, cross-sectional designs yielded more consistent evaluations of diarrhoea disease risk factors when those factors varied more between villages than over time. Cross-sectional studies can provide information that is representative across large geographic regions and therefore can provide insight for local, regional and national policy decisions.

Air bubbles at 10% of tumor volume and an equal volume of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), either with rIL-12 or pIL-12 were injected into the tumor. SW treatment consisted of 500 SWs (7.4-MPa peak negative pressure) from a spark-gap lithotripter. Tumor volume was measured every other day and tumor growth was statistically modeled. SW treatment augmented by air injection induced a tumor growth delay for a few days immediately after exposure. Intratumor rIL-12 injection enhanced the SW effect on tumor progression, to the extent that a statistically significant increase in survival was realized in both tumor models. pIL-12 injection alone, which is known to produce some gene transfer, provided no detectable tumor-growth reduction. The combination of SW and pIL-12 injection provided a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth relative to SW alone for both tumor models.

The goal of the current study was to estimate and compare the shape of the relationship between income and mortality in the USA for the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s.Using income and mortality data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for respondents aged 35-64 years, we used a Bayesian Cox Model with regression splines to model the risk of mortality over three 10-year follow-up periods. To identify whether income was more strongly associated with mortality at different parts of the income distribution, we treated income as a linear spline with an unknown knot location.The shape of the association between income and mortality was quite non-linear, with a much stronger association at lower levels of income. The relationship between income and mortality in the USA was also not invariant across time, with the increased risk of death associated with lower income applying to an increasing proportion of the US population over time (9th percentile of income in 1970-79, 20th percentile in 1980-89 and 32nd percentile in 1990-99).Our analyses do not support the claim that income is associated with mortality throughout the income distribution, nor is the association between income and mortality the same across periods.

The reasons for this are not well understood, although the level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is one well characterized ameliorating factor in both of these conditions. To better understand the genetic basis of this heterogeneity, we carried out genome-wide scans with 362,129 common SNPs on 4,305 Sardinians to look for genetic linkage and association with HbF levels, as well as other red blood cell-related traits. Among major variants affecting HbF levels, SNP rs11886868 in the BCL11A gene was strongly associated with this trait (P < 10(-35)). The C allele frequency was significantly higher in Sardinian individuals with elevated HbF levels, detected by screening for beta-thalassemia, and patients with attenuated forms of beta-thalassemia vs. those with thalassemia major. We also show that the same BCL11A variant is strongly associated with HbF levels in a large cohort of sickle cell patients. These results indicate that BCL11A variants, by modulating HbF levels, act as an important ameliorating factor of the beta-thalassemia phenotype, and it is likely they could help ameliorate other hemoglobin disorders.

At days 7, 14, and 28 after transfer, lymph node cells and splenocytes were examined for donor cell persistence and antigenic responsiveness by FACS and ELISA, respectively.In IL-2-treated mice, donor CD8+ T cells persisted and developed a memory phenotype, based on CD44 and Ly6c expression at day 28, while mice given no IL-2 had fewer donor cells at all time points. OVA-specific release of IFN-gamma was higher from lymphocytes of IL-2-treated mice compared with no-IL-2 mice (P<0.02 at all time points). In mice challenged with an OVA-bearing subline of the AML leukemia model C1498, IL-2 did not confer added protection from tumor challenge at 1 or 2 weeks after adoptive transfer, but gave improved survival at 4 weeks post-transfer.We conclude that exogenous IL-2 is not required for anti-tumor activity of CD3/CD28-activated CD8+ cells early after adoptive transfer, but promotes T-cell persistence that confers disease protection at more remote times.');

However, several known biological processes lead to skewed transmission probabilities among surviving offspring and, therefore, to excess genetic sharing among relatives.

Although these processes affect our basic understanding of inheritance, little is known about their overall impact in humans or other mammals. In this study, we examined genome screen data from 148 nuclear families, collected without reference to phenotype, to look for departures from Mendelian transmission proportions. Using single-point and multipoint linkage analysis, we detected a modest but significant genomewide shift towards excess genetic sharing among siblings (average sharing of 50.43% for the autosomes; P=.009). Our calculations indicate that many loci with skewed transmission are required to produce a genomewide shift of this magnitude. Since transmission distortion loci are subject to strong selection, this raises interesting questions about the evolutionary forces that keep them polymorphic.

On an even finer scale, the method improves discrimination between exome-sequenced study participants originating from different provinces within Finland. Finally, we show that our method can be used to improve case-control matching in genetic association studies and to reduce the risk of spurious findings due to population structure.');

Patients were eligible for a second cycle if disease progression was absent and performance status allowed. From August 1990 to June 1998, 29 males (25 NSGCT) were treated. At the time of ABMT, 10 were chemosensitive, four were chemoresistant, and 10 were absolutely refractory to platinum. Disease status (no. patients) at transplant: primary refractory disease (six), first relapse (10), second relapse (eight), third relapse (five). Fifteen (52%) received both transplants. Treatment-related mortality was 10%. Best response after ABMT included: two CR, one CR surgically NED, five PR, three PR surgically NED, seven SD, and eight PD. Eight (28%) patients are continuously progression-free a median 60 months (range, 31-93) from first ABMT. Three seminoma patients remain progression-free. Of five long-term NSGCT survivors, four were treated in first relapse with platinum-sensitive disease. Eighteen relapses occurred a median of 4 months after ABMT I (two late relapses at 28 and 44 months). The median PFS and OS for the whole group are 4 and 14 months, respectively. Patients with relapsed/ refractory testicular cancer benefit most from ABMT if they have platinum-sensitive disease in first relapse. Patients who do poorly despite ABMT have a mediastinal primary site, true cisplatin-refractory disease, disease progression prior to ABMT, and/or markedly elevated betaHCG at ABMT.

To clarify whether this trend reflects differences in kidney cancer patients or differences in surgeon practice styles, the authors compared the magnitude of surgeon-attributable variance in the use of partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy with that attributable to patient and tumor characteristics.By using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, the authors identified a cohort of 5483 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent surgery for kidney cancer between 1997 and 2002. Two primary outcomes were defined: 1) the use of partial nephrectomy and (2) the use of laparoscopy among patients undergoing radical nephrectomy. By using multilevel models, surgeon- and patient-level contributions to observed variations in the use of partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy were estimated.Of the 5483 cases identified, 611 (11.1%) underwent partial nephrectomy (43 performed laparoscopically), and 4872 (88.9%) underwent radical nephrectomy (515 performed laparoscopically). After adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidity, tumor size, and surgeon volume, the surgeon-attributable variance was 18.1% for partial nephrectomy and 37.4% for laparoscopy. For both outcomes, the percentage of total variance attributable to surgeon factors was consistently higher than that attributable to patient characteristics.For many patients with kidney cancer, the surgery provided depends more on their surgeon''s practice style than on the characteristics of the patient and his or her disease. Consequently, dismantling barriers to surgeon adoption of partial nephrectomy and laparoscopy is an important step toward improving the quality of care for patients with early-stage kidney cancer.');

BCL-X expression was detected in several human myeloma cell lines, as well as in CD38-sorted bone marrow cells obtained from some patients. Only the antiapoptotic long form of BCL-X (BCL-X-L), was detected. Because BCL-X-L expression can protect tumor cells from apoptotic death induced by chemotherapeutic agents, we tested the clinical relevance of expression in 55 archival bone marrow biopsies. The biopsies were stained by immunohistochemistry, and BCL-X expression was correlated with the subsequent response to treatment. BCL-X expression in malignant plasma cells strongly correlated with decreased response rates in patient groups treated with either melphalan and prednisone or vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone. Response rates were 83-87% in non-BCL-X-expressing cases and 20-31% in BCL-X-expressing cases. In addition, BCL-X expression was more frequent in specimens taken from patients at relapse (77%), when compared to those at initial diagnosis (29%). Further support for the association of drug resistance with BCL-X-L expression came from studies of the 8226 dox-40 cell line. This line, which expresses p-glycoprotein and serves as a model of multidrug resistance in multiple myeloma cells, demonstrated an up-regulated expression of BCL-X-L, which was relatively specific, in that BCL-2 or BAX expression was not altered. In addition, dox-40 cells demonstrated a generalized resistance to apoptosis that was induced by several different agents.

One method through which the ACE on survival can be estimated involves appropriately averaging over Cox-regression-based fitted survival functions. A second available method balances the treatment-specific covariate distributions through inverse probability of treatment weighting and then contrasts weighted nonparametric survival function estimators. Because both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, we propose methods that essentially combine both estimators. The proposed methods are double robust, in the sense that they are consistent if at least one of the two working regression models (i.e., logistic model for treatment and Cox model for death hazard) is correct. The proposed methods involve estimating the ACE with respect to restricted mean survival time, defined as the area under the survival curve up to some prespecified time point.

We studied 3257 participants from seven clinical sites in the Study of Women''s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) who were aged 42-52 yr at baseline and self-identified as African American (28.2%), Caucasian (47.1%), Chinese (7.7%), Hispanic (8.4%), or Japanese (8.6%). E2 and FSH were assayed in serum collected primarily in the early follicular phase of a spontaneous menstrual cycle in three consecutive annual visits. The primary explanatory variables included in repeated-measures regression analyses were race/ethnicity, menopausal status, age, body mass index (BMI), day of the cycle, smoking, parity, socioeconomic status, study site, and the self-report of diabetes at baseline. At the baseline visit, 46.2% of the women were classified as being early perimenopausal, with the remaining being premenopausal. By the second follow-up visit, 5.5% of the women in that cohort were postmenopausal, 66.8% were early perimenopausal, 8.3% were late perimenopausal, and 19.4% remained premenopausal. Serum E2 concentrations decreased significantly with age, with a steeper decline at higher ages. FSH concentrations increased significantly with age, with a steeper increase at higher ages. Similar patterns in the decline of E2 and the increase in FSH with age were found across ethnic groups, but the levels of these hormones differed by race/ethnicity. Specifically, over time, Chinese and Japanese women had lower E2 concentrations but similar FSH levels, compared with Caucasian women, and African American women had higher FSH concentrations but comparable E2 levels with those of Caucasian women. These ethnic differences in E2 and FSH were independent of menopausal status. The effect of BMI on serum E2 and FSH levels varied by menopausal status. Increasing BMI was associated with decreasing concentrations of E2 among premenopausal and early perimenopausal women but was associated with increasing concentrations of E2 among late perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Increasing BMI was associated with decreasing concentrations of FSH, with the effect of BMI becoming larger as women transitioned through menopause. We conclude that serum E2 levels decrease and FSH concentrations increase with increasing age in midlife women, that ethnic differences in E2 over time differ from ethnic differences in FSH and suggest ethnic differences in the pituitary-ovarian relationship, and that the effect of BMI on E2 and FSH concentrations varies by menopausal status.');

To better understand the role of genetic variants regulating cutaneous gene expression, we identified 841 cis-acting eQTLs using RNA extracted from skin biopsies of 53 psoriatic individuals and 57 healthy controls. We found substantial overlap between cis-eQTLs of normal control, uninvolved psoriatic, and lesional psoriatic skin. Consistent with recent studies and with the idea that control of gene expression can mediate relationships between genetic variants and disease risk, we found that eQTL SNPs are more likely to be associated with psoriasis than are randomly selected SNPs. To explore the tissue specificity of these eQTLs and hence to quantify the benefits of studying eQTLs in different tissues, we developed a refined statistical method for estimating eQTL overlap and used it to compare skin eQTLs to a published panel of lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) eQTLs. Our method accounts for the fact that most eQTL studies are likely to miss some true eQTLs as a result of power limitations and shows that â¼70% of cis-eQTLs in LCLs are shared with skin, as compared with the naive estimate of < 50% sharing.

Temporal change of PSA after treatment completion was described by a specially developed linear mixed model that included standard prognostic factors. These factors, along with predicted PSA evolution, were incorporated into a Cox model to establish their predictive value for the risk of clinical recurrence over time.Consistent relationships were found across cohorts. The initial PSA decline after radiation therapy was associated with baseline PSA and T-stage (p < 0.001). The long-term PSA rise was associated with baseline PSA, T-stage, and Gleason score (p < 0.001). The risk of clinical recurrence increased with current level (p < 0.001) and current slope of PSA (p < 0.001). In a pooled analysis, higher doses of radiation were associated with a lower long-term PSA rise (p < 0.001) but not with the risk of recurrence after adjusting for PSA trajectory (p = 0.63). Conversely, after adjusting for other factors, increased age at diagnosis was not associated with long-term PSA rise (p = 0.85) but was directly associated with decreased risk of recurrence (p < 0.001).We conclude that a linear mixed model can be reliably used to construct typical patient PSA profiles after prostate cancer radiation therapy.

In practice, however, the inaccuracy is not likely to be more than about 10%. When the tumor parameters are unknown and are estimated by fitting an empirical Poisson model to tumor-cure data from a homogeneous population of proliferative tumors, the resulting estimates of tumor growth rate and radiosensitivity accurately reflect the true values, but the estimate of initial clonogen number is biased downward.

In addition to being assessed for factors previously found to be associated with poor outcomes in arthroplasty, participants also completed the American College of Rheumatology survey criteria for fibromyalgia. Previous studies have suggested that rather than being "present" or "absent," features of fibromyalgia as measured by this instrument, occur over a wide continuum.

In the multivariate analysis, the fibromyalgia survey score, younger age, preoperative opioid use, knee (vs. hip), pain severity at baseline, and the anesthetic technique were all predictive of increased postoperative opioid consumption.The use of the survey criteria for fibromyalgia led to the finding of distinct phenotypic differences, and the measure was independently predictive of opioid consumption.

The workshop brought together statisticians and clinicians in an attempt to shed light on some unresolved issues in the use of HIV laboratory markers (such as HIV RNA and CD4+ cell counts) in the design and analysis of clinical studies and in patient management. Utilizing a debate format, the workshop explored a series of specific questions dealing with the relationship between markers and clinical endpoints, and the choice of endpoints and methods of analysis in clinical studies. This paper provides the position statements from the two debaters on each issue. Consensus conclusions, based on the presentations and discussion, are outlined. While not providing final answers, we hope that these discussions have helped clarify a number of issues, and will stimulate further consideration of some of the highlighted problems. These issues will be critical in the proper assessment and use of future therapies for HIV disease.');

However actual screening rates appear to be lower among black women compared with white women.To assess determinants of breast cancer screening among women in Michigan USA, focusing on individual and neighborhood socio-economic status and healthcare access.Data from 1163 women ages 50-74 years who participated in the 2008 Michigan Special Cancer Behavioral Risk Factor Survey were analyzed. County-level SES and healthcare access were obtained from the Area Resource File. Multilevel logistic regression models were fit using SAS Proc Glimmix to account for clustering of individual observations by county. Separate models were fit for each of the two outcomes of interest; mammography screening and clinical breast examination. For each outcome, two sequential models were fit; a model including individual level covariates and a model including county level covariates.After adjusting for misclassification bias, overall cancer screening rates were lower than reported by survey respondents; black women had lower mammography screening rates but higher clinical breast examination rates than white women. However, after adjusting for other individual level variables, race was not a significant predictor of screening. Having health insurance or a usual healthcare provider were the most important predictors of cancer screening.Access to healthcare is important to ensuring appropriate cancer screening among women in Michigan.');

The trial is conducted by the NICHD-funded Pelvic Floor Disorders Network.The ongoing OPUS trial started enrollment in May 2007 with a planned accrual of 350. The use of sham incision was generally well accepted but the collection of cost data using conventional billing forms was found to potentially unmask key study personnel. This necessitated changes in the study forms and planned timing for collection of cost data. To date, the enrollment to the patient preference group has been lower than the limit established by the protocol suggesting a willingness on the part of women to participate in the randomization.Given the invasive nature of surgical intervention trials, potential participants may be reluctant to accept random assignment, potentially impacting generalizability.Findings from the OPUS trial will provide important information that will help surgeons to better counsel women on the benefits and risks of concomitant prophylactic anti-incontinence procedure at the time of vaginal surgery for prolapse.

The 5-year cumulative incidence of isolated extramedullary or bone marrow relapse was 9% and 29%, respectively. Extramedullary relapse occurred later than marrow relapse and most frequently involved skin and soft tissue. Factors predictive of extramedullary relapse after transplantation included previous extramedullary disease, French-American-British classification M4/M5 leukemia, high risk cytogenetics, and advanced disease status at the time of transplantation. Children were more likely than adults to develop extramedullary relapse, a finding probably explained by an overrepresentation of extramedullary disease prior to transplantation and M4/M5 leukemia in children. Acute graft-versus-host disease was not protective against relapse. Unlike medullary relapse, chronic graft-versus-host disease was not protective against extramedullary relapse. The survival rate after extramedullary relapse was 30% at 1 year and 12% at 2 years.

We then quantify the relevance of genes to the trait from a GWA study by calculating similarity scores between their ontology fingerprints using enrichment p-values. We validate this approach by correctly identifying corresponding genes for biological pathways with a 90% average area under the ROC curve (AUC). We applied this approach to rank genes identified through a GWA study that are associated with the lipid concentrations in plasma as well as to prioritize genes within linkage disequilibrium (LD) block. We found that the genes with highest scores were: ABCA1, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and cholesterol ester transfer protein, plasma for high-density lipoprotein; low-density lipoprotein receptor, APOE and APOB for low-density lipoprotein; and LPL, APOA1 and APOB for triglyceride.

Three levels of neurological damage were used to grade the spinal cord response. Animals which did not develop paralysis were observed for at least 18 months after irradiation. The fractionated schedules consisted of either 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, or 20 fractions in addition to single doses. For the fractionated regimes the daily fraction size ranged from 2 Gy to 24 Gy, and for single doses the range was 12 Gy to 52 Gy. Both the latent time to paralysis and the incidence of paralysis were considered as endpoints. For analysis of the sparing associated with fractionation, the dose points were divided into two groups: a "low damage" group consisting of doses of near or less than the ED50 at 450 days and a "high damage" group consisting of doses much larger than the ED50 at 450 days in which there was 100% incidence of paralysis.The latent time depended on the radiation dose; for each fixed fraction number the latent period became progressively shorter with higher total doses. Differences in histology in fractionation sensitivity are observed between the two groups. The low damage data in each fractionation treatment are the important data in the analysis of long-term incidence of paralysis. On the other hand, the high damage data were emphasized for the analysis of latency. Three statistical methods (mixture model, Cox model, and Fe-plot) were used to fit the linear-quadratic dose response model and the "Nominal Standard Dose" (NSD) model. The values of the parameters of these two models depended on the effect evaluated; the latent interval from the high damage region being not very fractionation-dependent, whereas, the incidence of paralysis from the low damage fractionation regimens was strongly dependent on dose per fraction. Specifically, the alpha/beta ratios for latency were large (e.g., 17 to 57 Gy) when fractionation schemes in the high damage region were emphasized. If data from the fractionation schemes in the lower damage region with fraction size less than 15 Gy were emphasized, the alpha/beta ratios for incidence of paralysis were 3.3 (1.8, 6.0, 95% C.I.), 4.1 (2.8, 5.5), and 4.4 Gy derived by the mixture, Cox, and Fe-plot models, respectively. These "low damage" alpha/beta ratios were similar for all levels of injury from mild to complete paralysis, and are those which are more relevant to clinical radiotherapy. The coefficients for the "Nominal Standard Dose" formula in the present study were 0.33 +/- 0.01 (s.e.) (by the Strandqvist-type plot), 0.38 (the Cox model), or 0.40 (the mixture model) for level 2 injury at 450 days.The values of parameters in the isoeffect models were different when the data analyzed were derived from regimens using fractionated low or high damage doses.');

Specifically, we propose a generalized estimating equations (GEEs) based kernel association test, a variance component based testing method, to test for the association between a phenotype and multiple variants in an SNP set jointly using family samples. The proposed approach allows for both continuous and discrete traits, where the correlation among family members is taken into account through the use of an empirical covariance estimator. We derive the theoretical distribution of the proposed statistic under the null and develop analytical methods to calculate the P-values. We also propose an efficient resampling method for correcting for small sample size bias in family studies. The proposed method allows for easily incorporating covariates and SNP-SNP interactions. Simulation studies show that the proposed method properly controls for type I error rates under both random and ascertained sampling schemes in family studies. We demonstrate through simulation studies that our approach has superior performance for association mapping compared to the single marker based minimum P-value GEE test for an SNP-set effect over a range of scenarios.

The interviewer and caregiver watched a special 15-minute DVD developed specifically for this project based on data collected at Wave I and focused on how the caregivers can ''keep their children free from tooth decay''. After the MI session, the caregivers developed their own preventive goals. Some families in this group chose not to develop goals and were offered the project-developed goals.

The response to treatment is typically evaluated by measurements obtained from radiographic images several months after the start of treatment; therefore, an early biomarker of tumor response would be useful for making early treatment decisions and for prognostic information. Thirty-four patients with malignant glioma were examined by diffusion MRI before treatment and 3 weeks later. These images were coregistered, and differences in tumor-water diffusion values were calculated as functional diffusion maps (fDM), which were correlated with the radiographic response, time-to-progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Changes in fDM at 3 weeks were closely associated with the radiographic response at 10 weeks. The percentage of the tumor undergoing a significant change in the diffusion of water (V(T)) was different between patients with progressive disease (PD) vs. stable disease (SD) (P < 0.001). Patients classified as PD by fDM analysis at 3 weeks were found to have a shorter TTP compared with SD (median TTP, 4.3 vs. 7.3 months; P < 0.04). By using fDM, early patient stratification also was correlated with shorter OS in the PD group compared with SD patients (median survival, 8.0 vs. 18.2 months; P < 0.01).

Ensemble techniques improve the accuracy in prediction and address the instability in a single tree by growing an ensemble of trees and aggregating. However, in the process, individual trees get lost. In this paper, we propose a methodology for identifying the most representative trees in an ensemble on the basis of several tree distance metrics. Although our focus is on binary outcomes, the methods are applicable to censored data as well. For any two trees, the distance metrics are chosen to (1) measure similarity of the covariates used to split the trees; (2) reflect similar clustering of patients in the terminal nodes of the trees; and (3) measure similarity in predictions from the two trees. Whereas the latter focuses on prediction, the first two metrics focus on the architectural similarity between two trees. The most representative trees in the ensemble are chosen on the basis of the average distance between a tree and all other trees in the ensemble. Out-of-bag estimate of error rate is obtained using neighborhoods of representative trees. Simulations and data examples show gains in predictive accuracy when averaging over such neighborhoods. We illustrate our methods using a dataset of kidney cancer treatment receipt (binary outcome) and a second dataset of breast cancer survival (censored outcome).');

B 39:1-38) for case-control data can be used to estimate haplotype frequencies. But often we will have offspring for at least some of the spouse pairs, and offspring genotypes provide additional information about the haplotypes of the parents. Existing methods may either ignore the offspring information, or reconstruct haplotypes for the subjects using offspring information and discard data from those whose haplotypes cannot be reconstructed with high confidence. Neither of these approaches is efficient, and the latter approach may also be biased. For case-control data with some subjects forming spouse pairs and offspring genotypes available for some spouse pairs or individuals, we propose a unified, likelihood-based method of haplotype inference. The method makes use of available offspring genotype information to apportion ambiguous haplotypes for the subjects. For subjects without offspring genotype information, haplotypes are apportioned as in the standard EM algorithm for case-control data. Our method enables efficient haplotype frequency estimation using an EM algorithm and supports probabilistic haplotype reconstruction with the probability calculated based on the whole sample. We describe likelihood ratio and permutation tests to test for disease-haplotype association, and describe three test statistics that are potentially useful for detecting such an association.');

CT examinations per patient ranged from two to 10, and follow-up ranged from 1-123 months (mean 49 months, median 38.5 months). On each CT image, the aortic short axis (SA), false lumen (FL), and true lumen (TL) diameters were measured at the longitudinal midpoint of the dissection and at the point of maximum aortic diameter. Complications were tabulated, including aortic rupture and aortic enlargement requiring surgery.For non-operated patients, the midpoint and maximum point SA, TL, and FL diameters increased significantly over time. For operated patients, the midpoint and maximum point SA and FL diameters increased significantly over time. In both groups, aortic enlargement was predominantly due to FL expansion. Diameter increases in non-operated patients were significantly larger than those in operated patients. The rate of change in aortic diameter was constant, regardless of aortic size. Four non-operated and six operated patients developed aortic complications.In patients with a dissection involving the descending thoracic aorta, the FL increased in diameter over time, at a constant rate, and to a greater degree in non-operated patients (mostly type B) compared with operated patients (all type A).');

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the levels of which are elevated in lupus, possess oxidant-generating enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), NADPH oxidase (NOX), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We hypothesized that NETs mediate HDL oxidation, impairing cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC).Plasma MPO levels and CEC activity were examined in controls and lupus patients, and 3-chlorotyrosine (MPO specific) and 3-nitrotyrosine (derived from reactive nitrogen species) were quantified in human HDL. Multivariable linear models were used to estimate and test differences between groups. HDL was exposed to NETs from control and lupus neutrophils in the presence or absence of MPO, NOX, NOS inhibitors, and chloroquine (CQ). Murine HDL oxidation was quantified after NET inhibition in vivo.SLE patients displayed higher MPO levels and diminished CEC compared to controls. SLE HDL had higher 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine content than control HDL, with site-specific oxidation signatures on apolipoprotein A-I. Experiments with human and murine NETs confirmed that chlorination was mediated by MPO and NOX, and nitration by NOS and NOX. Mice with lupus treated with the NET inhibitor Cl-amidine displayed significantly decreased HDL oxidation. CQ inhibited NET formation in vitro.Active NOS, NOX, and MPO within NETs significantly modify HDL, rendering the lipoprotein proatherogenic. Since NET formation is enhanced in SLE, these findings support a novel role for NET-derived lipoprotein oxidation in SLE-associated CVD and identify additional proatherogenic roles of neutrophils and putative protective roles of antimalarials in autoimmunity.');

We applied an innovative method in which we tested for the effect of groups of genes defined according to cellular function (functional gene group analysis). Using an initial sample of 627 subjects, this functional gene group analysis detected that synaptic heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) play an important role in cognitive ability (P(EMP) = 1.9 x 10(-4)). The association with heterotrimeric G proteins was validated in an independent population sample of 1507 subjects. Heterotrimeric G proteins are central relay factors between the activation of plasma membrane receptors by extracellular ligands and the cellular responses that these induce, and they can be considered a point of convergence, or a "signaling bottleneck." Although alterations in synaptic signaling processes may not be the exclusive explanation for the association of heterotrimeric G proteins with cognitive ability, such alterations may prominently affect the properties of neuronal networks in the brain in such a manner that impaired cognitive ability and lower intelligence are observed. The reported association of synaptic heterotrimeric G proteins with cognitive ability clearly points to a new direction in the study of the genetic basis of cognitive ability.');

This artifact could be studied with the use of surfaces of different roughness to represent different rates of motion, in which roughness corresponds to spatial fluctuations in surface height. Given very slight variations in beam focusing as occurs with sonographic imaging arrays, these spatial fluctuations translate into temporal fluctuations in the received signal as would occur with tissue motion.We scanned 4 different sandpaper grits and a smooth surface through a water path using fundamental and PI mode, 1- and 2-pulse techniques, respectively. The sandpaper and the smooth surface were scanned through a water path at mechanical indices of 0.1 to 0.7. Four independent images were subtracted pairwise to remove nonfluctuating signals. These noise pixels were counted and analyzed.Analysis of variance showed that the noise generated behind the different surfaces was highly significantly different. Two-tailed t tests generally showed significant differences in the quantity of noise between fundamental and harmonic imaging behind the roughest 3 grades of sandpaper. A multiple regression model showed significantly greater slopes for harmonic imaging for all grades of sandpaper and the smooth surface.The noise and, by extension, the linear streak artifact in musculoskeletal imaging are dependent on the mechanical index and are functions of sandpaper roughness. This would be equivalent to a subtraction error between 2 firings due to soft tissue motion, and the artifact may be a way to identify rapid soft tissue motion in PI images.');

The strategies that were more influenced by death showed more negative changes over time and favored the group with fewer deaths. The choice of strategy should depend on the goals of an intervention. For health promotion studies, we recommend recoding the health variables to estimate the probability that a person will be healthy in 2 years (or in some other period that can be estimated from the data).');

The estimation of SRRs consists of two steps. First, we model the dependence of readmission events on facilities and patient-level characteristics, with or without an adjustment for discharging hospitals. Second, using results from the models, standardization is achieved by computing the ratio of the number of observed events to the number of expected events assuming a population norm and given the case-mix in that facility. A challenging aspect of our motivating example is that the number of parameters is very large and estimation of high-dimensional parameters is troublesome. To solve this problem, we propose a structured Newton-Raphson algorithm for a logistic fixed effects model and an approximate EM algorithm for the logistic mixed effects model. We consider a re-sampling and simulation technique to obtain p-values for the proposed measures. Finally, our method of identifying outlier facilities involves converting the observed p-values to Z-statistics and using the empirical null distribution, which accounts for overdispersion in the data. The finite-sample properties of proposed measures are examined through simulation studies. The methods developed are applied to national dialysis data. It is our great pleasure to present this paper in honor of Ross Prentice, who has been instrumental in the development of modern methods of modeling and analyzing life history and failure time data, and in the inventive applications of these methods to important national data problem.');

The ability to use noninvasive imaging during the early stages of fractionated therapy to determine whether a particular treatment will be effective would provide an opportunity to optimize individual patient management and avoid unnecessary systemic toxicity, expense, and treatment delays. We investigated whether changes in the Brownian motion of water within tumor tissue as quantified by using diffusion MRI could be used as a biomarker for early prediction of treatment response in brain cancer patients. Twenty brain tumor patients were examined by standard and diffusion MRI before initiation of treatment. Additional images were acquired 3 weeks after initiation of chemo- and/or radiotherapy. Images were coregistered to pretreatment scans, and changes in tumor water diffusion values were calculated and displayed as a functional diffusion map (fDM) for correlation with clinical response. Of the 20 patients imaged during the course of therapy, 6 were classified as having a partial response, 6 as stable disease, and 8 as progressive disease. The fDMs were found to predict patient response at 3 weeks from the start of treatment, revealing that early changes in tumor diffusion values could be used as a prognostic indicator of subsequent volumetric tumor response. Overall, fDM analysis provided an early biomarker for predicting treatment response in brain tumor patients.');

The latent variables account for the correlated nature of multiple endpoints and accommodate the fact that some clinical endpoints are categorical variables and others are censored variables. The mixture normal hierarchical structure admits a natural variable selection rule. Inference was conducted using the posterior distribution sampling Markov chain Monte Carlo method.

For 8, 12, and 16 markers and all combinations of numbers of hybrids, retention patterns, and marker spacings considered, the probabilities that the true order is identified as the best order were considerably higher with the ML and PP methods than with the MB method.

Our results can be used as guidelines for determining sample size requirements and optimal marker spacing for future RH mapping experiments. For equally spaced markers, intermarker spacing of 30 to 50 cR gave the highest probability of correctly ordering all the markers. For randomly spaced markers, 10-20 cR average intermarker spacing resulted in the highest proportion of markers being placed in a 1000:1 framework map.

We propose an expanded PL method using a Bayesian framework to incorporate informative censoring mechanism and perform sensitivity analysis on estimates of the cumulative incidence curves.

The sensitivity parameters relate the odds of an event, between subjects from a missing-data pattern with the observed subjects for each interval.

Then we vary the mean and variance to explore sensitivity of inferences.

The factor II 20210 G to A transition was present more often in women with MI (5.1%) than among control women (1.6%). The age-adjusted odds ratio for MI was 4.0 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 15.1). The relative risk was high when another major cardiovascular risk factor was also present, such as smoking (odds ratio 43.3, 95% confidence interval 6.7 to 281), and the risk seemed limited to those with other risk factors. These results, in which the effect of major coronary risk factors is enhanced fourfold to sixfold by the prothrombin variant, are similar to those previously reported for another genetic clotting abnormality, factor V Leiden. We conclude that factor II 20210 G to A increases the risk of myocardial infarction in young women, especially in the women with other major risk factors for coronary heart disease.');

The purpose of this study is to identify whether overexpression of the active human transforming growth factor-ss1 (ahTGF-ss1) can downregulate expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and reduce ischemic brain injury.-Overexpression of transforming growth factor-ss1 (TGF-ss1) was achieved through adenoviral gene transfer. Five days after adenoviral transduction, the mouse underwent 30 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 1 to 7 days of reperfusion. TGF-ss1, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, and ICAM-1 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry. Infarct areas and volumes were measured by cresyl violet staining.-MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha expression is increased after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and double-labeled immunostaining revealed that MCP-1 is colocalized with neurons and astrocytes. Viral-mediated TGF-ss1 overexpression was significantly greater at measured time points, with a peak at 7 to 9 days. The expression of MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha, but not ICAM-1, was reduced in the mice overexpressing ahTGF-ss1 (P:<0.05). Furthermore, infarct volume was significantly reduced in the mice overexpressing ahTGF-ss1 (P:<0.05).-This study demonstrates that MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha expressed in the ischemic region may play an important role in attracting inflammatory cells. The reduction of MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha, but not ICAM-1, in the mice overexpressing ahTGF-ss1 suggests that the neuroprotective effect of TGF-ss1 may result from the inhibition of chemokines during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.');

Rap1GAP functions by switching off Rap1, the Ras-like protein that has been associated with carcinogenesis. Previous findings suggest that Rap1GAP acts as a tumor suppressor protein in SCC by delaying the G(1)-S transition of the cell cycle. However, cells transfected with Rap1GAP exhibit a more invasive phenotype than corresponding vector-transfected control cells. MMP2 and MMP9 are enzymes that mediate SCC invasion via degradation of the extracellular matrix. Using SCC cells transfected with empty vector or Rap1GAP, cell invasion and MMP secretion were determined by Matrigel assays and gelatin zymography, respectively. Rap1GAP up-regulated transcription and secretion of MMP2 and MMP9, as assayed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and zymography. Furthermore, chemical and RNA interference blockade of MMP2/MMP9 inhibited invasion by Rap1GAP-transfected cells. Immunohistochemical staining of a human oropharyngeal SCC tissue microarray showed that Rap1GAP and MMP9 expression and staining intensity are correlated (P < 0.0001) and that, in early N-stage lesions of SCC, high MMP9 is prognostic of poor disease-specific survival (P < 0.05). Furthermore, Rap1GAP staining is correlated with MMP2 (P < 0.03). MMP2 in combination with N stage has a prognostic effect on time to indication of surgery at primary site. MMP2 intensity is also positively correlated with T stage (P < 0.015). In conclusion, Rap1GAP inhibits tumor growth but induces MMP2- and MMP9-mediated SCC invasion and tumor progression, suggesting a role for this protein as a biomarker for early N-stage, aggressive SCCs.');

Expression of two splicing forms was lower in pancreatic islets with increasing counts of T2D-associated alleles of the SNPs: a ubiquitous splicing form (P = 0.018 for rs7903146 and P = 0.020 for rs12255372) and a splicing form found in pancreatic islets, pancreas and colon but not in other tissues tested here (P = 0.009 for rs12255372 and P = 0.053 for rs7903146).

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1762,11791214,'Gene-mapping studies routinely rely on checking for Mendelian transmission of marker alleles in a pedigree, as a means of screening for genotyping errors and mutations, with the implicit assumption that, if a pedigree is consistent with Mendel''s laws of inheritance, then there are no genotyping errors. However, the occurrence of inheritance inconsistencies alone is an inadequate measure of the number of genotyping errors, since the rate of occurrence depends on the number and relationships of genotyped pedigree members, the type of errors, and the distribution of marker-allele frequencies. In this article, we calculate the expected probability of detection of a genotyping error or mutation as an inheritance inconsistency in nuclear-family data, as a function of both the number of genotyped parents and offspring and the marker-allele frequency distribution. Through computer simulation, we explore the sensitivity of our analytic calculations to the underlying error model. Under a random-allele-error model, we find that detection rates are 51%-77% for multiallelic markers and 13%-75% for biallelic markers; detection rates are generally lower when the error occurs in a parent than in an offspring, unless a large number of offspring are genotyped. Errors are especially difficult to detect for biallelic markers with equally frequent alleles, even when both parents are genotyped; in this case, the maximum detection rate is 34% for four-person nuclear families. Error detection in families in which parents are not genotyped is limited, even with multiallelic markers. Given these results, we recommend that additional error checking (e.g., on the basis of multipoint analysis) be performed, beyond routine checking for Mendelian consistency. Furthermore, our results permit assessment of the plausibility of an observed number of inheritance inconsistencies for a family, allowing the detection of likely pedigree-rather than genotyping-errors in the early stages of a genome scan.

To explore the utility of conditioning on probands to correct for multiple ascertainment, we calculated the asymptotic value of the segregation ratio for two versions of the simple Mendelian segregation model on sibship data. For both versions, we found that this asymptotic value decreased approximately linearly as the ascertainment probability increased. When ascertainment was complete, the segregation-ratio estimates were zero, not just asymptotically but for finite sample size as well. In some cases, conditioning on probands actually resulted in greater parameter bias than no ascertainment correction at all.

Patients were treated with duloxetine for 8 weeks (30 mg for 7 days, then 60 mg daily). The primary endpoint was a 30% decrease in average pain score over 8 weeks, and secondary outcomes included change in average and worst pain, pain interference, depression, sleep quality, and hot flashes. Statistical analysis was done with t tests for paired data.Twenty-one of 29 evaluable patients (72.4%) achieved at least a 30% decrease in average pain, and 18 of 23 patients (78.3%) who completed protocol-directed treatment continued duloxetine. The mean percentage reduction in average pain severity between baseline and 8 weeks was 60.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.6%-73.1%), and in maximum pain severity it was 59.9% (95% CI, 47.0-72.7%). The most common adverse events were grade 1 or 2 fatigue, xerostomia, nausea, and headache.Duloxetine appears to be effective and well tolerated for treatment of AI-associated musculoskeletal symptoms.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1772,17641970,'A marginal regression approach for correlated censored survival data has become a widely used statistical method. Examples of this approach in survival analysis include from the early work by Wei et al. (J Am Stat Assoc 84:1065-1073, 1989) to more recent work by Spiekerman and Lin (J Am Stat Assoc 93:1164-1175, 1998). This approach is particularly useful if a covariate''s population average effect is of primary interest and the correlation structure is not of interest or cannot be appropriately specified due to lack of sufficient information. In this paper, we consider a semiparametric marginal proportional hazard mixture cure model for clustered survival data with a surviving or "cure" fraction. Unlike the clustered data in previous work, the latent binary cure statuses of patients in one cluster tend to be correlated in addition to the possible correlated failure times among the patients in the cluster who are not cured. The complexity of specifying appropriate correlation structures for the data becomes even worse if the potential correlation between cure statuses and the failure times in the cluster has to be considered, and thus a marginal regression approach is particularly attractive. We formulate a semiparametric marginal proportional hazards mixture cure model. Estimates are obtained using an EM algorithm and expressions for the variance-covariance are derived using sandwich estimators. Simulation studies are conducted to assess finite sample properties of the proposed model. The marginal model is applied to a multi-institutional study of local recurrences of tonsil cancer patients who received radiation therapy. It reveals new findings that are not available from previous analyses of this study that ignored the potential correlation between patients within the same institution.');

We extend our previous work on estimation using auxiliary variables to adjust for dependent censoring via multiple imputation, to the comparison of two survival distributions. To conduct the imputation, we use two working models to define a set of similar observations called the imputing risk set. One model is for the event times and the other for the censoring times. Based on the imputing risk set, a nonparametric multiple imputation method, Kaplan-Meier imputation, is used to impute a future event or censoring time for each censored observation. After imputation, the conventional nonparametric two-sample tests can be easily implemented on the augmented data sets. Simulation studies show that the sizes of the log-rank and Wilcoxon tests constructed on the imputed data sets are comparable to the nominal level and the powers are much higher compared with the tests based on the unimputed data in the presence of dependent censoring if either one of the two working models is correctly specified. The method is illustrated using AIDS clinical trial data comparing ZDV and placebo, in which CD4 count is the time-dependent auxiliary variable.');

Exclusion of genotypes incompatible with the phenotypic information and pedigree structure reduces the ranges of summation and simplifies the likelihood calculation. To evaluate the likelihood with the fewest possible arithmetic operations requires carrying out the summations over one individual at a time and the intervening multiplications in some appropriate order. Each such removal of an individual reduces the likelihood evaluation to another evaluation of the same numerical form. Greedy-type algorithms are suggested for determining an order in which the summations and multiplications may be carried out. The greedy methods are fast and appear to generate good removal sequences. They are shown to work well when applied to a large, complex pedigree.');

Such methods should account for an intimate connection between the probability of cure and the shape of the hazard function.The study was performed on survival data for 13,166 women with breast carcinoma identified through the Utah Cancer Registry and stratified by clinical stage and age at diagnosis. For these patients, the follow-up period was 30 years. Three estimation procedures were used for estimating the hazard function from the data: the life table estimator, a kernel counterpart of the Nelson-Aalen estimator, and a parametric estimator specifically designed for two-component hazards. The parametric estimate of the hazard function was used to provide estimates of cure rates for each category of patients.For all categories of patients under study, the estimated hazard functions passed through a clear-cut maximum, showing a tendency to decrease as time approached the end of a follow-up period. The hazards appeared to be nonproportional across the strata. The estimated values of the cure rate and the corresponding confidence intervals were determined for each stratum of patients with breast carcinoma.The results of the current study strongly suggest that cure is a possible outcome of breast carcinoma treatment.

Longitudinal mixed models were used to relate menopausal status to measures of physical functioning. Perception of physical functioning was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 questionnaire.

In this article, we propose a two-stage procedure to make inferences about such subject-specific profiles. For the first step, we use a parametric model to obtain a univariate risk index score system. We then estimate consistently the average competing risks for subjects who have the same parametric index score via a nonparametric function estimation procedure. We illustrate this new proposal with the data from a randomized clinical trial for evaluating the efficacy of a treatment for prostate cancer.

We show that this combined linkage/association model provides an estimate of the additive genetic variance of a trait that is attributable to disequilibrium between the marker and QTL. We use this estimate to construct approximate boundaries of the minimum level of disequilibrium between an observed marker and unobserved QTL and to delimit the permissible range of allele frequencies at the QTL based on available data at nearby markers.

Such studies are needed to improve clinical practice guidelines for cancer pain management over the course of treatment. Among patients with metastatic breast cancer, we assessed the impact of baseline clinical and demographic risk factors on patients reaching different pain severity and interference scores. We analyzed data originally collected in a clinical trial of two bisphosphonate therapies. Pain was measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) severity and interference with daily living 0-10 subscales. We fit univariate (per-cutpoint) and multivariate (cutpoints 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the BPI) proportional hazards models to identify predictors of pain outcomes over 51 weeks among 1,124 women with metastatic breast cancer. Predictors included race, age, education, geographic region, performance status, chemotherapy versus hormonal therapy only, time from first bone metastasis to randomization, and previous skeletal-related event (SRE, e.g., fractures, spinal cord compression). Non-Caucasian women had greater hazards for reaching higher cutpoints (5 and above) on the severity scale than Caucasian women (hazard ratio [HR] for cutpoint 5 interaction term=1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.37-2.26). For the interference scale, these hazards were greater for those patients with restricted (versus active) baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (HR for cutpoint 5 interaction term=2.51; 95% CI=2.01-3.13). In the multivariate severity model, other factors associated with higher pain severity were restricted baseline ECOG performance status, previous SRE, and not being employed full-time at baseline (HRs=1.70, 1.23, and 1.33, respectively). Our findings that non-Caucasian race and restricted performance status were associated with greater pain hazards over time confirm previous cross-sectional findings that these characteristics are pain risk factors. Because we found that the most influential demographic and clinical baseline factors had predictive value for worsening outcomes as early as cutpoint 5, we recommend that pain management strategies use cutpoints informed by risk factors for worsening outcomes as cues for earlier intervention, thus delaying or preventing worst pain among women with metastatic disease who are at greatest risk.');

The decrease in the serum total TEQ was largely due to the down-weighting of the TEFs for the majority of mono-ortho PCBs. In contrast, the decrease in the soil total TEQ was mostly due to the down-weighting of the TEF for 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) (1998 TEF=0.5, 2005 TEF=0.3). For household dust, the decrease in total TEQ was not due to any single TEF but was due to small changes in a number of compounds. There was a dramatic decrease (-88%) in the mean and 95th percentile for mono-ortho PCB TEQ due to the 2005 TEFs.These findings suggest that comparisons between studies based on the TEQ-WHO(98) and TEQ-WHO(05) may need to consider an appropriate conversion factor to assure comparability.

Our findings provide fresh insights into the mechanisms regulating heart rate and identify new therapeutic targets.');

Oral glucose tolerance tests and genotyping of SNPs in or near PPARG, KCNJ11, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, LOC387761, CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, HNF1B, WFS1, JAZF1, CDC123, TSPAN8, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2, KCNQ1, and MTNR1B were performed. HNF1B rs757210 was excluded because of failure to achieve Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.Six SNPs (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2B, CDKAL1, and MTNR1B) were significantly (P < 6.9 x 10(-4)) and two SNPs (KCNJ11 and IGF2BP2) were nominally (P < 0.05) associated with early-phase insulin release (InsAUC(0-30)/GluAUC(0-30)), adjusted for age, BMI, and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda ISI). Combined effects of these eight SNPs reached -32% reduction in InsAUC(0-30)/GluAUC(0-30) in carriers of >or=11 vs. <or=3 weighted risk alleles. Four SNPs (SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, and TCF7L2) were significantly or nominally associated with indexes of proinsulin conversion. Three SNPs (KCNJ11, HHEX, and TSPAN8) were nominally associated with Matsuda ISI (adjusted for age and BMI). The effect of HHEX on Matsuda ISI became significant after additional adjustment for InsAUC(0-30)/GluAUC(0-30). Nine SNPs did not show any associations with examined traits.Eight type 2 diabetes-related loci were significantly or nominally associated with impaired early-phase insulin release.

Severity of immune suppression was indicated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pediatric HIV Disease Classification System, based on CD4 percentages. The total number of negative life events-categorized as none, 1, or >1 life event reported as having occurred in the previous 12 months (previous 6 months for children <3 years of age)-was the predictor variable. Multiple logistic regressions were estimated to assess the relationship of negative life events and immune suppression at outcome, controlling for baseline measures of immune suppression, continuous CD4%, negative life events, age, race/ethnicity, gender, primary caretaker, education level of caretaker, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome status.At week 52, 379 subjects (61% of total study population) had moderate to severe immune suppression. Of 275 children with normal immune function at baseline, 68 (24.7%) subsequently developed moderate to severe suppression levels by week 52 of follow-up. Of 343 children with immune suppression at baseline, 32 (9.2%) had recovered to normal CD4% levels by week 52. More than 1 negative life event was associated with an increased risk (prevalence) of immune suppression (odds ratio [OR]: 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44,5.31), controlling for baseline CD4%, total life events, and other covariates. Children without immune suppression at baseline who experienced >1 negative life event had an increased incidence of immune suppression (OR: 2.93; 95% CI: 1.34,6.39), controlling for baseline covariates.Results indicate that negative stressful life events increase the risk of children with HIV-1 infection having impaired immune function. Further research is needed to identify potential mechanisms of the relationship between stressful life events and impaired immune function. These mechanisms include psychoneuroendocrinologic response and difficulties in adherence to therapy after exposure of a child to major negative life events.');

This number was projected to climb to 32,952 by the end of 2005, for a relative increase of 85% and a mean annual increase of 5.8%. The increased prevalence was projected to be greatest for peritoneal dialysis (6.0% annually), followed by hemodialysis (5.9%) and functioning kidney transplant (5.7%). The projected annual increases in prevalence by province ranged from 4.4%, in Saskatchewan, to 7.5%, in Alberta.The projected increases are plausible when one considers that the incidence of ESRD per million population in the United States and other countries far exceeds that in Canada.

We employed hierarchical linear models with time-varying covariates in depicting temporal variations in functional status between men and women.As a quadratic function, the worsening of functional status was more accelerated in terms of the intercept and rate of change among women and those in older age groups. In addition, gender differences in the level of functional impairment were more substantial in older persons than in younger individuals, although differences in the rate of change between men and women remained constant across age groups.A life course perspective can lead to new insights regarding gender variations in health within the context of intrapersonal and interpersonal differences.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1801,10739757,'The identification of genes contributing to complex diseases and quantitative traits requires genetic data of high fidelity, because undetected errors and mutations can profoundly affect linkage information. The recent emphasis on the use of the sibling-pair design eliminates or decreases the likelihood of detection of genotyping errors and marker mutations through apparent Mendelian incompatibilities or close double recombinants. In this article, we describe a hidden Markov method for detecting genotyping errors and mutations in multilocus linkage data. Specifically, we calculate the posterior probability of genotyping error or mutation for each sibling-pair-marker combination, conditional on all marker data and an assumed genotype-error rate. The method is designed for use with sibling-pair data when parental genotypes are unavailable. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we explore the effects of map density, marker-allele frequencies, marker position, and genotype-error rate on the accuracy of our error-detection method. In addition, we examine the impact of genotyping errors and error detection and correction on multipoint linkage information. We illustrate that even moderate error rates can result in substantial loss of linkage information, given efforts to fine-map a putative disease locus. Although simulations suggest that our method detects </=50% of genotyping errors, it generally flags those errors that have the largest impact on linkage results. For high-resolution genetic maps, removal of the errors identified by our method restores most or nearly all the lost linkage information and can be accomplished without generating false evidence for linkage by removing incorrectly identified errors.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1802,18805493,'Cluster extent and voxel intensity are two widely used statistics in neuroimaging inference. Cluster extent is sensitive to spatially extended signals while voxel intensity is better for intense but focal signals.

Simulation studies have shown that of the different cluster permutation methods, the cluster mass statistic is generally the best. However, to date, there is no parametric cluster mass inference available. In this paper, we propose a cluster mass inference method based on random field theory (RFT). We develop this method for Gaussian images, evaluate it on Gaussian and Gaussianized t-statistic images and investigate its statistical properties via simulation studies and real data. Simulation results show that the method is valid under the null hypothesis and demonstrate that it can be more powerful than the cluster extent inference method. Further, analyses with a single subject and a group fMRI dataset demonstrate better power than traditional cluster size inference, and good accuracy relative to a gold-standard permutation test.');

Desaturation during the 6MWT was associated with increased mortality even if a threshold of 88% was not reached. Baseline walk distance predicted subsequent walk distance but was not a reliable predictor of subsequent mortality in multivariate survival models. The predictive ability of serial changes in physiology varied when patients were stratified by the presence/absence of desaturation < or = 88% during a baseline 6MWT. For patients with a baseline saturation < or = 88% during a 6MWT, the strongest observed predictor of mortality was serial change in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide. For patients with saturation > 88% during their baseline walk test, serial decreases in FVC and increases in desaturation area significantly predicted subsequent mortality, whereas decreases in walk distance and in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide displayed less consistent statistical evidence of increasing mortality in our patients.These data highlight the importance of stratifying patients by degree of desaturation during a 6MWT before attributing prognostic value to serial changes in other physiologic variables.');

The direct costs of illness and injury--resource expenditures for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of medical and dental conditions--were $153.9 billion, or 40.3 percent of total costs. Indirect costs--economic losses from morbidity and mortality--were $227.9 billion, or 59.7 percent of total costs. Of indirect costs, $104.9 billion resulted from productivity losses because of morbidity, and $123.0 billion represent the present value of lost productivity from premature mortality based on a net effective discount rate of 4 percent. These estimates, based on data from the 1980. National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES), differ from other estimates of the costs of illness and injury in 1980 (Gibson and Waldo, 1982; Rice, Hodgson, and Kopstein, 1985). The differences, which can be resolved, are attributable to two major factors: (1) NMCUES includes only the civilian noninstitutionalized population, but the other estimates include the institutionalized population and the military; and (2) NMCUES indirect cost estimates for the population unable to work include persons who were retired for health reasons in 1979 and 1980, disabled homemakers, and other persons who were disabled for the entire year 1980 but were not retired for health reasons in 1979, but the Rice et al. estimates do not include the last two categories in the population unable to work. The principal NMCUES findings on the total costs of illness in the civilian noninstitutionalized population reinforce the importance of considering distributional effects. Persons 65 years of age and over represent one-tenth of this population yet account for more than one-fourth of direct costs and more than their share of total costs, even though the institutionalized elderly are excluded. More than two-thirds of total costs for this age category are accounted for by direct costs. Direct costs also account for more than two-thirds of total costs for people under 17 years of age. However, this youngest age category, which constitutes over one-fourth of the civilian noninstitutionalized population, generates only 12.3 percent of direct costs. In contrast, indirect costs account for well more than 60 percent of total costs for the working-age population (17-64 years of age).

However, substantial cardiac denervation was also seen in some patients with MSA and PSP.

No correlation was found between cardiac (11)C-HED retention and striatal (11)C-DTBZ binding.Cardiac sympathetic denervation was found to occur not only in IPD but also in other movement disorders, such as MSA and PSP. This finding implies that scintigraphic detection of cardiac sympathetic denervation cannot be used independently to discriminate IPD from other movement disorders, such as MSA and PSP. Cardiac sympathetic denervation was not correlated with striatal denervation, suggesting that the pathophysiologic processes underlying cardiac denervation and striatal denervation occur independently in patients with parkinsonian syndromes.

Standard logistic regression analysis using age as a covariate is based on a dichotomous outcome and does not efficiently use such age-at-onset (time-to-event) information. We propose to analyze age-at-onset data using a modified case-cohort method by treating the control group as an approximation of a subcohort assuming rare events. We investigate the asymptotic bias of this approximation and show that the asymptotic bias of the proposed estimator is small when the disease rate is low. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed method through a simulation study and illustrate the method using a breast cancer case-control data set.');

A statistically significant relationship was noted between radon-progeny exposure and risk of lung cancer mortality. Our analysis found no effect for age at first exposure. Attained age was strongly predictive of excess relative risk (ERR) per working level month (WLM) of radon exposure, falling from 0.025 for those aged less than 50 years to 0.002 for those 70 years or older. An inverse exposure-rate effect was also observed, wherein for equal total exposure, a high exposure rate (and short duration) is less harmful than a low exposure rate (and long duration). The ERR/WLM increased from 0.0019 for exposures of less than 10 years to 0.0076 for exposures of 20 or more years. The analysis of time-since-exposure windows revealed a greater ERR/WLM for exposures received in more recent periods, similar to the result for time since last exposure. Excess relative risks per WLM were higher for current smokers than for nonsmokers (never and former smokers).

Existing Bayesian methods may be used to predict the date of the landmark event, based on current enrollment, event, and loss to follow-up, if treatment arms are known. This work extends these methods to the case where the treatment arms are masked by using a parametric mixture model with a known mixture proportion. Posterior simulation using the mixture model is compared with methods assuming a single population. Comparison of the mixture model with the single-population approach shows that with few events, these approaches produce substantially different results and that these results converge as the prediction time is closer to the landmark event.

In analysis of rare variants in sequencing studies, region-based multimarker tests are often used to increase power.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) stimulates the expression of alpha2beta1 integrin on PC-3 cells. The current study investigated the effects of the above cytokines and DHT (singularly and in various combinations) upon HBME and prostate cancer cell expression of VCAM, alpha2 integrin subunit, and beta1 integrin subunit by flow cytometry. We also monitored the effects of the above treatments on PC-3 cell adhesion to HBME monolayers. The data demonstrate that none of the treatments significantly altered the expression of selected CAMs on HBME cell and neoplastic prostate cell lines. The treatment of HBME monolayers with various combinations of cytokines and DHT prior to performing adhesion assays with PC-3 demonstrates that treatments containing TGF-beta reduced PC-3 cell adhesion to HBME monolayers by 32% or greater (P < 0.05). The reduction in PC-3 cell adhesion to TGF-beta-treated HBME monolayers was dose dependent. Interestingly, LNCaP cells but not PC-3 cells treated with TGF-beta had a reduced ability to adhere to untreated HBME monolayers.

Further, the Bayesian approach is flexible in allowing a general pattern of missingness for the cause of death.

Statistical analyses derived odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for service use and unmet needs after controlling for race, employment/school status, sex, relationship status, severity of cancer, treatment, and treatment-related side effects.AYAs ages 20 to 29 years were significantly less likely than teens and older patients ages 30 to 39 years to report using professional mental health services and were significantly more likely to report an unmet need with regard to cancer information, infertility information, and diet/nutrition information. Compared with teens who were treated in pediatric facilities, AYAs who were treated in adult facilities were more likely to report an unmet need for age-appropriate Internet sites, professional mental health services, camp/retreats programs, transportation assistance, and complementary and alternative health services.Substantial proportions of AYAs are not getting their psychosocial care needs met.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1849,20878717,'Anticipation, manifested through decreasing age of onset or increased severity in successive generations, has been noted in several genetic diseases. Statistical methods for genetic anticipation range from a simple use of the paired t-test for age of onset restricted to affected parent-child pairs to a recently proposed random effects model which includes extended pedigree data and unaffected family members [Larsen et al., 2009]. A naive use of the paired t-test is biased for the simple reason that age of onset has to be less than the age at ascertainment (interview) for both affected parent and child, and this right truncation effect is more pronounced in children than in parents. In this study, we first review different statistical methods for testing genetic anticipation in affected parent-child pairs that address the issue of bias due to right truncation. Using affected parent-child pair data, we compare the paired t-test with the parametric conditional maximum likelihood approach of Huang and Vieland [1997] and the nonparametric approach of Rabinowitz and Yang [1999] in terms of Type I error and power under various simulation settings and departures from the modeling assumptions. We especially investigate the issue of multiplex ascertainment and its effect on the different methods. We then focus on exploring genetic anticipation in Lynch syndrome and analyze new data on the age of onset in affected parent-child pairs from families seen at the University of Michigan Cancer Genetics clinic with a mutation in one of the three main mismatch repair (MMR) genes. In contrast to the clinic-based population, we re-analyze data on a population-based Lynch syndrome cohort, derived from the Danish HNPCC-register. Both datasets indicate evidence of genetic anticipation in Lynch syndrome. We then expand our review to incorporate recently proposed statistical methods that consider family instead of affected pairs as the sampling unit. These prospective censored regression models offer additional flexibility to incorporate unaffected family members, familial correlation and other covariates into the analysis. An expanded dataset from the Danish HNPCC-register is analyzed by this alternative set of methods.');

The kernel machine (KM)-testing framework is a useful approach that has been proposed for testing associations between multiple genetic variants and many different types of complex traits by comparing pairwise similarity in phenotype between subjects to pairwise similarity in genotype, with similarity in genotype defined via a kernel function. An advantage of the KM framework is its flexibility: choosing different kernel functions allows for different assumptions concerning the underlying model and can allow for improved power. In practice, it is difficult to know which kernel to use a priori because this depends on the unknown underlying trait architecture and selecting the kernel which gives the lowest P-value can lead to inflated type I error. Therefore, we propose practical strategies for KM testing when multiple candidate kernels are present based on constructing composite kernels and based on efficient perturbation procedures. We demonstrate through simulations and real data applications that the procedures protect the type I error rate and can lead to substantially improved power over poor choices of kernels and only modest differences in power vs. using the best candidate kernel.');

We analyzed variants obtained from a population-based sequencing study of 202 genes in >14,000 individuals.

The influence of local GC content on rare variants differed from that on common variants or substitutions, and the differences varied by variant subtype. Furthermore, recombination rate and recombination hotspots have little effect on rare variants of any subtype, yet both have a relatively strong impact on multiple variant subtypes in common variants and substitutions. This observation is consistent with the effect of biased gene conversion or selection-dependent processes.

Understanding the accuracy of self-reported data and developing prediction models that correct for underreporting of hypertension in self-reported data can be critical tools in the development of more accurate population level estimates, and in planning population-based interventions to reduce the risk of, or more effectively treat, hypertension. This study examines the accuracy of self-reported survey data in describing prevalence of clinically measured hypertension in two racially and ethnically diverse urban samples, and evaluates a mechanism to correct self-reported data in order to more accurately reflect clinical hypertension prevalence.We analyze data from the Detroit Healthy Environments Partnership (HEP) Survey conducted in 2002 and the National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES) 2001-2002 restricted to urban areas and participants 25 years and older. We re-calibrate measures of agreement within the HEP sample drawing upon parameter estimates derived from the NHANES urban sample, and assess the quality of the adjustment proposed within the HEP sample.Both self-reported and clinically assessed prevalence of hypertension were higher in the HEP sample (29.7 and 40.1, respectively) compared to the NHANES urban sample (25.7 and 33.8, respectively). In both urban samples, self-reported and clinically assessed prevalence is higher than that reported in the full NHANES sample in the same year (22.9 and 30.4, respectively). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy between clinical and self-reported hypertension prevalence were ''moderate to good'' within the HEP sample and ''good to excellent'' within the NHANES sample. Agreement between clinical and self-reported hypertension prevalence was ''moderate to good'' within the HEP sample (kappa =0.65; 95% CIâ=â0.63-0.67), and ''good to excellent'' within the NHANES sample (kappa = 0.75; 95%CIâ=â0.73-0.80). Application of a ''correction'' rule based on prediction models for clinical hypertension using the national sample (NHANES) allowed us to re-calibrate sensitivity and specificity estimates for the HEP sample. The adjusted estimates of hypertension in the HEP sample based on two different correction models, 38.1% and 40.5%, were much closer to the observed hypertension prevalence of 40.1%.Application of a simple prediction model derived from national NHANES data to self-reported data from the HEP (Detroit based) sample resulted in estimates that more closely approximated clinically measured hypertension prevalence in this urban community.

In the analysis of plasma lipids, we detected an association between the variant and HDL ratios (HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol) (p = 0.013), which remained significant even after adjusting for sex, affection status and age.

Retrospective analyses of clinical parameters with respect to survival in 96 patients with epidemic Kaposi''s sarcoma indicated that earlier tumor stage, the lack of prior opportunistic infections, and the absence of systemic symptoms correlated most closely with survival. Sixteen immune parameters were also assessed for their prognostic value. Total T4 (CD-4) cell number levels and the T4: T8 ratio correlated most closely with survival. Response to treatment with recombinant alpha interferons, while not well correlated with tumor stage, was more frequent in patients without systemic symptoms or a history or prior opportunistic infections. Treatment response was associated with a greater degree of intact T-cell function. These findings emphasize the importance of cellular immunity in the pathogenesis and subsequent course of patients with epidemic Kaposi''s sarcoma, suggesting that different therapeutic strategies may be necessary to address specific prognostic subgroups.');

We also extend the simulation model to compare the efficiency of the two designs in settings where multiple Phase II studies are used to make decisions about moving on to a Phase III study.For a one-arm design the probability of correctly identifying an effective experimental agent tends to be at least 0.7 in the cases considered, with the corresponding value for a randomized two-arm design within 0.05-0.10 above or below the one-arm design. An increase in total sample size from 30 patients to 80 patients tends to increase the probability of correctly identifying an effective experiment agent more in the two-arm design than the the one-arm design, particularly when the uncertainty in the historical response rate is large.These results for binary response measures are derived from the specific scenarios and assumptions considered in the simulation study and may not apply to situations outside the range considered.We find that a one-arm design is preferred for small sample sizes, but a two-arm design may be preferred with larger sample sizes or if the uncertainty in the historical response rates is large.');

The lack of a reduction in pain perception among the slower runners may be because an extreme bout of exercise of this nature can "exhaust" the systems responsible for exercise-induced analgesia in all but the most well-trained of runners, or that these systems were not activated because the slower runners were unable to maintain a high enough exercise intensity during the later stages of the race.');

The challenges of evaluating the health impacts of environmental factors in a multipollutant model include, but are not limited to: identification of the most critical components of the pollutant mixture, examination of potential interaction effects, and attribution of health effects to individual pollutants in the presence of multicollinearity.In this paper, we reviewed five methods available in the statistical literature that are potentially helpful for constructing multipollutant models. We conducted a simulation study and presented two data examples to assess the performance of these methods on feature selection, effect estimation and interaction identification using both cross-sectional and time-series designs. We also proposed and evaluated a two-step strategy employing an initial screening by a tree-based method followed by further dimension reduction/variable selection by the aforementioned five approaches at the second step.Among the five methods, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression performs well in general for identifying important exposures, but will yield biased estimates and slightly larger model dimension given many correlated candidate exposures and modest sample size. Bayesian model averaging, and supervised principal component analysis are also useful in variable selection when there is a moderately strong exposure-response association. Substantial improvements on reducing model dimension and identifying important variables have been observed for all the five statistical methods using the two-step modeling strategy when the number of candidate variables is large.There is no uniform dominance of one method across all simulation scenarios and all criteria. The performances differ according to the nature of the response variable, the sample size, the number of pollutants involved, and the strength of exposure-response association/interaction. However, the two-step modeling strategy proposed here is potentially applicable under a multipollutant framework with many covariates by taking advantage of both the screening feature of an initial tree-based method and dimension reduction/variable selection property of the subsequent method. The choice of the method should also depend on the goal of the study: risk prediction, effect estimation or screening for important predictors and their interactions.');

Building on the framework set out by Jewell and Kalbfleisch (1992), we study these two survival distributions based on stochastic models for the marker process (X(t)) and a marker-dependent hazard (h(.)).

Using simulation and numerical integration, we find the marginal incubation period distribution, the marginal hazard and the residual time distribution for several combinations of marker processes and marker-dependent hazards.

After adjusting for age, gender, severity, and insurance type, receipt of spirometry did not affect the likelihood of future emergency department asthma use.Children with Medicaid insurance are less likely to receive spirometry testing. Reasons may be because of access to care, inadequate provider referral for testing, or patient preferences. Objective lung function tests, such as spirometry, are a potentially important component of monitoring chronic disease status.

The extent to which common variation determines the phenotype of highly heritable traits such as height is uncertain, as is the extent to which common variation is relevant to individuals with more extreme phenotypes. To address these questions, we studied 1,214 individuals from the top and bottom extremes of the height distribution (tallest and shortest â¼1.5%), drawn from â¼78,000 individuals from the HUNT and FINRISK cohorts. We found that common variants still influence height at the extremes of the distribution: common variants (49/141) were nominally associated with height in the expected direction more often than is expected by chance (p<5Ã10â»Â²â¸), and the odds ratios in the extreme samples were consistent with the effects estimated previously in population-based data. To examine more closely whether the common variants have the expected effects, we calculated a weighted allele score (WAS), which is a weighted prediction of height for each individual based on the previously estimated effect sizes of the common variants in the overall population. The average WAS is consistent with expectation in the tall individuals, but was not as extreme as expected in the shortest individuals (p<0.006), indicating that some of the short stature is explained by factors other than common genetic variation. The discrepancy was more pronounced (p<10â»â¶) in the most extreme individuals (height<0.25 percentile). The results at the extreme short tails are consistent with a large number of models incorporating either rare genetic non-additive or rare non-genetic factors that decrease height. We conclude that common genetic variants are associated with height at the extremes as well as across the population, but that additional factors become more prominent at the shorter extreme.');

Several methods have been proposed to match cases and controls prior to genotyping, using family information or epidemiological data, or using genotype data for a modest number of genetic markers. Here, we describe a genetic similarity score matching (GSM) method for efficient matched analysis of cases and controls in a genome-wide or large-scale candidate gene association study. GSM comprises three steps: (1) calculating similarity scores for pairs of individuals using the genotype data; (2) matching sets of cases and controls based on the similarity scores so that matched cases and controls have similar genetic background; and (3) using conditional logistic regression to perform association tests. Through computer simulation we show that GSM correctly controls false-positive rates and improves power to detect true disease predisposing variants. We compare GSM to genomic control using computer simulations, and find improved power using GSM. We suggest that initial matching of cases and controls prior to genotyping combined with careful re-matching after genotyping is a method of choice for genome-wide association studies.');

The function of beta-cat in neoplastic transformation is dependent on T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factors, but specific genes activated by the interaction of beta-cat with TCFs in OEAs and other cancers with Wnt pathway defects are largely unclear. As a strategy to identify beta-cat/TCF transcriptional targets likely to contribute to OEA pathogenesis, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to compare gene expression in primary OEAs with mutational defects in beta-cat regulation (n = 11) to OEAs with intact regulation of beta-cat activity (n = 17). Both hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis based on global gene expression distinguished beta-cat-defective tumors from those with intact beta-cat regulation. We identified 81 potential beta-cat/TCF targets by selecting genes with at least 2-fold increased expression in beta-cat-defective versus beta-cat regulation-intact tumors and significance in a t test (P < 0.05). Seven of the 81 genes have been previously reported as Wnt/beta-cat pathway targets (i.e., BMP4, CCND1, CD44, FGF9, EPHB3, MMP7, and MSX2). Differential expression of several known and candidate target genes in the OEAs was confirmed.

Here, we use simulations and experimental genotypes to evaluate its accuracy and utility, considering choices of genotyping panels, reference panel configurations, and designs where genotyping is replaced with shotgun sequencing. Importantly, we show that genotype imputation not only facilitates cross study analyses but also increases power of genetic association studies. We show that genotype imputation of common variants using HapMap haplotypes as a reference is very accurate using either genome-wide SNP data or smaller amounts of data typical in fine-mapping studies.

The current model assumes that fragments are generated in the ancestral cell of a clone according to an independent Poisson breakage process along each chromosome. Once generated, fragments are independently retained in the clone with a common retention probability. On the basis of this and less restrictive retention models, statistical criteria such as minimum obligate breaks, maximum likelihood ratios, and Bayesian posterior probabilities can be used to decide locus order. Distances can be estimated by maximum likelihood. Likelihood computation is particularly challenging, and computing techniques from the theory of hidden Markov chains prove crucial.

Antibody levels to H. pylori predicted incident stroke in fully adjusted models (Odds Ratio: 1.58; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.09, 2.28). No significant associations were found between stroke risk and antibody levels to the other four pathogens. No associations were found for pathogen burden and incident stroke in fully adjusted models.Our results suggest that exposure to H. pylori may be a stroke risk factor in Mexican Americans and may contribute to ethnic differences in stroke risk given the increased prevalence of exposure to H. pylori in this population. Future studies are needed to confirm this association.');

In actual medical practice, patients receive a schedule comprised of several courses of treatment, and some patients may receive one or more dose reductions or delays during treatment. Consequently, the overall risk of toxicity for each patient is a function of both actual schedule of treatment and the differing doses used at each adminstration.Our goal is to provide a practical phase I clinical trial design that more accurately reflects actual medical practice by accounting for both dose per administration and schedule.We propose an outcome-adaptive Bayesian design that simultaneously optimizes both dose and schedule in terms of the overall risk of toxicity, based on time-to-toxicity outcomes. We use computer simulation as a tool to calibrate design parameters.We describe a phase I trial in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation that was designed and is currently being conducted using our new method. Our computer simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms any method that searches for an optimal dose but does not allow schedule to vary, both in terms of the probability of identifying optimal (dose, schedule) combinations, and the numbers of patients assigned to those combinations in the trial.Our design requires greater sample sizes than those seen in traditional phase I studies due to the larger number of treatment combinations examined. Our design also assumes that the effects of multiple administrations are independent of each other and that the hazard of toxicity is the same for all administrations.Our design is the first for phase I clinical trials that is sufficiently flexible and practical to truly reflect clinical practice by varying both dose and the timing and number of administrations given to each patient.');

A 5-day modified concurrent biochemotherapy regimen of dacarbazine, vinblastine, cisplatin, decrescendo IL-2, interferon alfa-2b, and tamoxifen was repeated at 21-day intervals. G-CSF was administered beginning on day 6 for 7 to 10 days.The overall response rate was 57% (95% confidence interval, 42% to 72%), the complete response rate was 23%, and the partial response rate was 34%. Complete remissions were achieved in an additional 11% of patients by surgical resection of residual disease after biochemotherapy. The median time to progression was 6.3 months and the median duration of survival was 11.4 months. At a maximum follow-up of 36 months (range, 10 to 36 months), 32% of patients are alive and 14% remain free of disease. Decrescendo IL-2 dosing and administration of G-CSF seemed to reduce toxicity, length of hospital stay, and readmission rates.

In this study, we examined MT1-MMP expression in 58 primary human cervical tissue specimens, including normal cervix, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), high-grade SILs (HSIL), and invasive carcinomas. We also evaluated MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 expression in several cervical cancer-derived cell lines, human papillomavirus (HPV)-immortalized keratinocytes, and keratinocytes derived from a LSIL. Using in situ hybridization techniques to study the cervical tissue specimens, we found that MT1-MMP expression increases with cervical tumor progression (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.66; P < 0.0001, exact test). Specifically, MT1-MMP expression is very low or absent in normal cervix and LSILs, is readily detectable in HSILs, and is very strongly expressed in nearly all invasive carcinomas. Most but not all cervical cancer-derived cell lines also expressed significant levels of MT1-MMP and MMP-2. Constitutive expression of exogenous MT1-MMP in cervical carcinoma-derived cells and HPV-immortalized keratinocytes with low endogenous levels of MT1-MMP induced invasiveness in collagen I, but this effect was not observed in LSIL-derived keratinocytes. Our results show that MT1-MMP is a key enzyme mediating cervical cancer progression. However, MT1-MMP alone is not always sufficient for inducing keratinocyte invasiveness at least in the collagen I invasion assay used in this study.

Reported overdiagnosis estimates have also been variable, ranging from 25% to greater than 80% of screen-detected cancers.We used three independently developed mathematical models of prostate cancer progression and detection that were calibrated to incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program to estimate lead times and the fraction of overdiagnosed cancers due to PSA screening among US men aged 54-80 years in 1985-2000. Lead times were estimated by use of three definitions.

Diabetes also is associated with microvascular disease and autonomic neuropathy; and, these non-coronary atherosclerotic pathophysiologic processes also have the potential to increase the risk of SCA. In this report, we review the absolute and relative risk of SCA associated with diabetes. We summarize recent evidence that suggests that the increase in risk in patients with diabetes is not specific for SCA, as diabetes also is associated with a similar increase in risk for non-SCA CHD death and non-fatal myocardial infarction. These data are consistent with prior observations that coronary atherosclerosis is a major contributor to the increased SCA risk associated with diabetes. We also present previously published and unpublished data that demonstrates that both clinically-recognized microvascular and autonomic neuropathy also are associated with the risk of SCA among treated patients with diabetes, after taking into account prior clinically-recognized heart disease and other risk factors for SCA. We then discuss how these data might inform research and clinical efforts to prevent SCA. Although the prediction of SCA in this "high" risk population is likely to remain a challenge, as it is in other "high" risk clinical populations, we suggest that current recommendations for the prevention of SCA in the community, related to both lifestyle prescriptions and risk factor reduction, are likely to reduce mortality from SCA among patients with diabetes.');

For normally distributed traits and in large samples, the method is found to give the correct type I error rate and an unbiased estimate of the proportion of trait variance accounted for by the additive effects of the locus-although, in cases where asymptotic theory is doubtful, significance levels should be checked by simulations.

A simulation model for the cytogenetic response (per cent of Philadelphia chromosome positive metaphases) serially measured in CML patients was constructed to describe roughly the sparse information available in medical literature. The model was used to construct a summary measure of response and to formulate the treatment effect as a regression with U-shape distributed ordered categorical data. Two simple models (vertical shift model and pooled conditional response model) were specifically designed to model the treatment effect ''observed'' in a simulated ''pilot'' data set. The powers were contrasted with the traditional proportional odds and binary models. The comparison was based both on repeated sampling from the simulated model and on bootstrap of ''given'' pilot data set. We show that the specific models that address the treatment effect directly (as anticipated from pilot data) can gain in power as compared to the traditional proportional odds model when evaluated by bootstrap. However, the proportional odds model appears to be better with repeated sampling from the simulation model. To explain this discrepancy we generated ''pilot data sets'' repeatedly from the simulation model and showed that the ordering of the bootstrap power estimates is unstable with reasonably complex models dependent on the random fall of the pilot data sets. This phenomenon clearly limits the usefulness of subtle modelling the form of the treatment difference observed in a small pilot data set.');

This study uses several powerful techniques to characterize dependency structures of mixture components in personal exposure measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with aims of advancing the understanding of environmental mixtures, improving the ability to model mixture components in a statistically valid manner, and demonstrating broadly applicable techniques. We first describe characteristics of mixtures and introduce several terms, including the mixture fraction which represents a mixture component''s share of the total concentration of the mixture. Next, using VOC exposure data collected in the Relationship of Indoor Outdoor and Personal Air (RIOPA) study, mixtures are identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF) and by toxicological mode of action. Dependency structures of mixture components are examined using mixture fractions and modeled using copulas, which address dependencies of multiple variables across the entire distribution. Five candidate copulas (Gaussian, t, Gumbel, Clayton, and Frank) are evaluated, and the performance of fitted models was evaluated using simulation and mixture fractions. Cumulative cancer risks are calculated for mixtures, and results from copulas and multivariate lognormal models are compared to risks calculated using the observed data. Results obtained using the RIOPA dataset showed four VOC mixtures, representing gasoline vapor, vehicle exhaust, chlorinated solvents and disinfection by-products, and cleaning products and odorants. Often, a single compound dominated the mixture, however, mixture fractions were generally heterogeneous in that the VOC composition of the mixture changed with concentration. Three mixtures were identified by mode of action, representing VOCs associated with hematopoietic, liver and renal tumors. Estimated lifetime cumulative cancer risks exceeded 10(-3) for about 10% of RIOPA participants. Factors affecting the likelihood of high concentration mixtures included city, participant ethnicity, and house air exchange rates. The dependency structures of the VOC mixtures fitted Gumbel (two mixtures) and t (four mixtures) copulas, types that emphasize tail dependencies. Significantly, the copulas reproduced both risk predictions and exposure fractions with a high degree of accuracy, and performed better than multivariate lognormal distributions. Copulas may be the method of choice for VOC mixtures, particularly for the highest exposures or extreme events, cases that poorly fit lognormal distributions and that represent the greatest risks.');

To date, no prospective controlled trial has sufficiently answered this question, and the present prospective outcome study attempts to compare survival with CRRT versus that with IHD.Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the impact of RRT modality choice (CRRT vs. IHD) on in-hospital and 100-day mortality among ARF patients receiving RRT during 2000 and 2001 at University of Michigan, using an "intent-to-treat" analysis adjusted for multiple comorbidity and severity factors.Overall in-hospital mortality before adjustment was 52%. Triage to CRRT (vs IHD) was associated with higher severity and unadjusted relative rate (RR) of in-hospital death (RR = 1.62, p = 0.001, n = 383). Adjustment for comorbidity and severity of illness reduced the RR of death for patients triaged to CRRT and suggested a possible survival advantage (RR = 0.81, p = 0.32). Analysis restricted to patients in intensive care for more than five days who received at least 48 hours of total RRT, showed the RR of in-hospital mortality with CRRT to be nearly 45% lower than IHD (RR = 0.56, n = 222), a difference in RR that indicates a strong trend for in-hospital mortality with borderline statistical significance (p = 0.069). Analysis of 100-day mortality also suggested a potential survival advantage for CRRT in all cohorts, particularly among patients in intensive care for more than five days who received at least 48 h of RRT (RR = 0.60, p = 0.062, n = 222).Applying the present methodology to outcomes at a single tertiary medical center, CRRT may appear to afford a survival advantage for patients with severe ARF treated in the ICU. Unless and until a prospective controlled trial is realized, the present data suggest potential survival advantages of CRRT and support broader application of CRRT among such critically ill patients.');

The development of rapid point-of-care (POC) chairside diagnostics has the potential for the early detection of periodontal infection and progression to identify incipient disease and reduce health care costs. However, validation of effective diagnostics requires the identification and verification of biomarkers correlated with disease progression. This clinical study sought to determine the ability of putative host- and microbially derived biomarkers to identify periodontal disease status from whole saliva and plaque biofilm.One hundred human subjects were equally recruited into a healthy/gingivitis group or a periodontitis population. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects and analyzed using antibody arrays to measure the levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and bone resorptive/turnover markers.Salivary biomarker data were correlated to comprehensive clinical, radiographic, and microbial plaque biofilm levels measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for the generation of models for periodontal disease identification. Significantly elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and -9 were found in subjects with advanced periodontitis with Random Forest importance scores of 7.1 and 5.1, respectively. The generation of receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that permutations of salivary biomarkers and pathogen biofilm values augmented the prediction of disease category. Multiple combinations of salivary biomarkers (especially MMP-8 and -9 and osteoprotegerin) combined with red-complex anaerobic periodontal pathogens (such as Porphyromonas gingivalis or Treponema denticola) provided highly accurate predictions of periodontal disease category. Elevated salivary MMP-8 and T. denticola biofilm levels displayed robust combinatorial characteristics in predicting periodontal disease severity (area under the curve = 0.88; odds ratio = 24.6; 95% confidence interval: 5.2 to 116.5).Using qPCR and sensitive immunoassays, we identified host- and bacterially derived biomarkers correlated with periodontal disease.

The impact of primary treatment was expressed as a fraction of the difference between observed mortality and projected mortality in the absence of treatment benefit.The 3 models projected that changes in treatment explained 22% to 33% of the mortality decline by 2005. These contributions were accounted for mostly by surgery and radiation therapy, which increased in frequency until the 1990s, whereas hormone therapies contributed little to the mortality decline by 2005.

Transplant candidates can choose whether to accept an ECD organ (experimental therapy), or to remain on dialysis and wait for a possible non-ECD transplant later (conventional therapy).

Our proposed method, evolutionary-symmetric transversion parsimony, is a hybrid that retains the consistency of evolutionary parsimony, while increasing power by incorporating a modified form of transversion parsimony within a statistical model. The method requires choice of a parameter gamma that represents the prior probability that symmetric transversion parsimony yields consistent results. Properties of the method are assessed for a variety of choices of gamma in a large simulation study. In general, inference under the evolutionary-symmetric transversion parsimony has more discriminating power than inference under evolutionary parsimony and is better calibrated than inference under symmetric transversion parsimony. The results are quite robust to the choice of gamma, indicating a value of 0.90 as a reasonable overall choice when the true value of gamma ranges between 0.85 to 1.00.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) was performed on 15 patients with HNSCC at baseline and 3 weeks after treatment initiation of a nonsurgical organ preservation therapy (NSOPT) using concurrent radiation and chemotherapy. PRM was applied on serial apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps that were spatially aligned using a deformable image registration algorithm to measure the tumor volume exhibiting significant changes in ADC (PRM(ADC)). Pretherapy and midtherapy ADC maps, quantified from the DWIs, were analyzed by monitoring the percent change in whole-tumor mean ADC and the PRM metric. The prognostic values of percentage change in tumor volume and mean ADC and PRM(ADC) as a treatment response biomarker were assessed by correlating with tumor control at 6 months. Pixel-wise differences as part of PRM(ADC) analysis revealed regions where water mobility increased. Analysis of the tumor ADC histograms also showed increases in mean ADC as early as 3 weeks into therapy in patients with a favorable outcome. Nevertheless, the percentage change in mean ADC was found to not correlate with tumor control at 6 months. In contrast, significant differences in PRM(ADC) and percentage change in tumor volume were observed between patients with pathologically different outcomes. Observations from this study have found that diffusion MRI, when assessed by PRM(ADC), has the potential to provide both prognostic and spatial information during NSOPT of head and neck cancer.');

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(1973,7558943,'To investigate the importance to outcome of treatment for squamous cell carcinomas of the tonsillar fossa, of dose per fraction, overall treatment duration, and total dose.A collaborative retrospective study was undertaken in nine centers that used widely different dose-fractionation patterns for external beam radiation therapy.There were 676 eligible cases treated only with photon beams during the years 1976-1985. The probability of local control (of the tonsillar fossa primary) was influenced by both T-stage and N-stage. Significant treatment parameters were total dose and overall treatment duration, but not dose per fraction. Over the range of about 40 to 90% and for a constant overall treatment duration, local tumor control probability increased by nearly 2% for each 1 Gy increase in total dose. For a constant total dose there was a decrease in the probability of local control associated with prolongation of overall treatment duration, presumed to result from accelerated regrowth of surviving tumor clonogens during the course of treatment. If it is assumed that accelerated regrowth occurred at a constant rate and began within 9 days of the start of treatment, an average of 0.53 Gy extra dose per day''s extension of treatment would be required to maintain a constant probability of local control. Correspondingly, the probability of local control from a constant dose would be lowered by an average of at least 1% for each day''s extension of treatment duration. However, the data are slightly more consistent with an average delay of as long as 30 days before onset of accelerated repopulation, with a consequent increase to an average of 0.73 Gy per day for the value of the compensatory dose. The alpha/beta ratio for this tumor is high enough that the effect of fraction size on the probability of local control can be ignored; a precise estimate is not possible because the best value for beta was close to zero. After accounting for the significant variables studied (treatment time, T-stage, N-stage), the dose-response curves for tumor control were still shallow, suggesting that there are additional causes for heterogeneity of responses among these tumors.Total dose is important to treatment outcome: After accounting for other treatment variables, there is about a 2% per Gy increase in probability of tumor control over the ranges of control commonly achieved. Overall treatment duration is important. There is at least a 1% per day decrease in tumor control probability if delivery of a constant total dose is prolonged, requiring a compensatory increase in dose by 0.5-0.7 Gy per day to achieve a constant rate of tumor control. Fraction size is not, of itself, an important factor in the response of primary carcinoma of the tonsil. If a tumor has demonstrated a capacity for metastatic spread to lymph nodes, a higher total dose should be considered to achieve control rates at the primary site equivalent to those in node negative patients. Even after accounting for variables such as tumor stage, total dose, and overall treatment duration, there is sufficient heterogeneity in other undocumented determinants of tumor control to cause the tumor control probability curve to be a shallow function of dose.');

A retrospective cohort study design was used to identify mortality risk factors. All patient information was collected at enrollment. Life-table analyses and discrete logistic regression were used to identify a period of elevated mortality risk. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) measuring associations between patient characteristics and mortality and to examine whether these associations changed during the first year of HD. Among 4802 incident patients, risk for death was elevated during the first 120 d compared with 121 to 365 d (27.5 versus 21.9 deaths per 100 person-years; P = 0.002). Cause-specific mortality rates were higher in the first 120 d than in the subsequent 121 to 365 d for nearly all causes, with the greatest difference being for cardiovascular-related deaths. In addition, 20% of all deaths in the first 120 d occurred subsequent to withdrawal from dialysis. Most covariates were found to have consistent effects during the first year of HD: Older age, catheter vascular access, albumin <3.5, phosphorus <3.5, cancer, and congestive heart failure all were associated with elevated mortality. Pre-ESRD nephrology care was associated with a significantly lower risk for death before 120 d (HR 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.83) but not in the subsequent 121- to 365-d period (HR 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.27).

We assessed the relationship between self-esteem and all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models.Low self-esteem was associated with a two-fold [hazard ratio (HR)=2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.3-3.2] increase in age-adjusted mortality. This relationship was partially explained by behavioral and socioeconomic factors, and prevalent diseases, and fully explained by other psychosocial characteristics (hopelessness, depression, cynical hostility, and sullenness). When adjusted for hopelessness alone there was no increased risk associated with low self-esteem (HR=1.3, 95% CI=0.8-2.2).This study found no association between self-esteem and all-cause mortality after adjustment for other psychosocial characteristics, primarily hopelessness.

The tumor stage distribution was Stage I in 5, Stage II in 8, Stage III in 6, and Stage IV in 4 patients. All patients underwent primary nephrectomy followed by multiagent chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (RT).

To analyze the outcomes of adult patients treated in the "modern era," the data from this report were combined with the data from 22 patients with FHWT previously reported in 1990 by the NWTSG.The 5-year relapse-free survival, overall survival, and disease-specific survival (DSS) rate was 77.3%, 82.6%, and 95.7%, respectively, for patients registered in the NWTS 4-5 protocols. Three patients (13%) died of chemotherapy-induced hepatic venoocclusive disease. For a total of 45 adults with FHWTs treated in the "modern era," the overall survival rate was 82%. The survival rate for those with Stage I, II, III, and IV disease was 100%, 92%, 70%, and 73%, respectively. Of the 12 Stage I-II patients treated with two drugs and no RT, the survival rate was 100%. The survival rate for Stage III and IV patients treated with three drugs and RT was 63% and 70%, respectively.The results of this report demonstrate that adults with FHWT treated with a multimodality approach similar to NWTSG protocols have good survival.

Even though several risk factors for preterm birth have been identified, prevention efforts have failed to halt the increasing rates of preterm birth. Epidemiological studies have identified air pollution as an emerging potential risk factor for preterm birth. However, many studies were limited by study design and inadequate exposure assessment. Due to the ubiquitous nature of ambient air pollution and the potential public health significance of any role in causing preterm birth, a novel focus investigating possible causal mechanisms influenced by air pollution is therefore a global health priority. We hypothesize that air pollution may act together with other biological factors to induce systemic inflammation and influence the duration of pregnancy. Evaluation and testing of this hypothesis is currently being conducted in a prospective cohort study in Mexico City and will provide an understanding of the pathways that mediate the effects of air pollution on preterm birth. The important public health implication is that crucial steps in this mechanistic pathway can potentially be acted on early in pregnancy to reduce the risk of preterm birth.');

A potential use of S is to completely replace T as a surrogate endpoint to evaluate whether the treatment is effective. Another potential use of S is to serve as an auxiliary variable to help provide information and improve the inference on the treatment effect prediction when T is not completely observed. The objective of this report is to focus on its role as an auxiliary variable and to identify situations when S can be useful to increase efficiency in predicting the treatment effect in a new trial in a multiple-trial setting. Both S and T are continuous. We find that higher efficiency gain is associated with higher trial-level correlation but not individual-level correlation when only S, but not T is measured in a new trial; but, the amount of information recovery from S is usually negligible. However, when T is partially observed in the new trial and the individual-level correlation is relatively high, there is substantial efficiency gain by using S. For design purposes, our results suggest that it is often important to collect markers that have high adjusted individual-level correlation with T and at least a small amount of data on T.

A key aspect in the efficiency of association studies is the notion of "indirect association," where only a subset of SNPs are collected to serve as proxies for the uncollected SNPs, taking advantage of the correlation structure between SNPs. Recently, a new class of methods for indirect association, multimarker methods, has been proposed. Although the multimarker methods are a considerable advancement, current methods do not fully take advantage of the correlation structure between SNPs and their multimarker proxies. In this article, we propose a novel multimarker indirect-association method, WHAP, that is based on a weighted sum of the haplotype frequency differences. In contrast to traditional indirect-association methods, we show analytically that there is a considerable gain in power achieved by our method compared with both single-marker and multimarker tests, as well as traditional haplotype-based tests.

We enrolled 677 cases that had been shot in an assault and 684 population-based controls. The relationships between 2 independent variables of interest, alcohol consumption and alcohol outlet availability, and the outcome of being assaulted with a gun were analyzed. Conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for numerous confounding variables.After adjustment, heavy drinkers were 2.67 times as likely to be shot in an assault when compared with nondrinkers (p < 0.10) while light drinkers were not at significantly greater risk of being shot in an assault when compared with nondrinkers. Regression-adjusted analyses also demonstrated that being in an area of high off-premise alcohol outlet availability significantly increased the risk of being shot in an assault by 2.00 times (p < 0.05). Being in an area of high on-premise alcohol outlet availability did not significantly change this risk. Heavy drinkers in areas of high off-premise alcohol outlet availability were 9.34 times (p < 0.05) as likely to be shot in an assault.This study finds that the gun assault risk to individuals who are near off-premise alcohol outlets is about the same as or statistically greater than the risk they incur from heavy drinking. The combination of heavy drinking and being near off-premise outlets resulted in greater risk than either factor alone. By comparison, light drinking and being near on-premise alcohol outlets were not associated with increased risks for gun assault.

Rates of MBC in Africa are more variable than in the U.S., therefore, understanding the risk factors involved in a population like Egypt can clarify the nature of MBC. The polyglutamine tract (QT) is a variable region of the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear receptor which is important in modulating androgen actions and generally inhibits growth in breast tissue. It is hypothesized that a long QT results in weaker AR activity over the lifetime, resulting in less AR mediated control over cellular division and higher risk of MBC. As a corollary, we expect to see a distribution skewed toward longer QTs in MBC patients compared to controls and overall relatively longer QT''s in populations with higher rates of MBC. This study aimed to investigate for the first time the distribution of AR QT lengths among MBC patients in Egypt. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 44 Egyptian MBC patients were analyzed for this polymorphism. Amplification followed by fragment length analysis revealed QT length. For the control series, blood from 43 Egyptian males without a family or personal history of breast or prostate cancers was collected and analyzed similarly. There was no significant difference between patients and controls with respect to mean QT length (P = 0.84; means were 19.5 Â± 2.8 and 19.3 Â± 4.2, for patients and controls, respectively). Though, short QT lengths were more prevalent among controls (14.0%), but almost absent in cases (2.3%). Although the mean lengths were not different in cases and controls, the near absence of short tracts in cases suggests a possible protective effect of very short QT lengths against MBC.

Point prevalence data were collected from our program in October 1997, and technique and patient survival data for the period 1990-1996 were analyzed and compared to data for the remainder of Canada from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register. Mortality rate ratios were estimated using a Poisson regression model to correct for comorbidity, age, and end-stage renal disease etiology. Of 141 in-center hemodialysis patients, 91 had an AV fistula, 1 had a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, and 49 were catheter-dependent. The program also included 20 home hemodialysis patients with AV fistulae, and 156 patients on peritoneal dialysis. No mortality risk differences between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are seen in our center, nor are they seen for each modality in comparison with the remainder of Canada. Technique survival for peritoneal dialysis at our center was about 80% at 2 years, significantly greater than for Canada. For the program as a whole, 49% of patients used peritoneal dialysis 35% a native AV fistula, and 15% a central catheter. For Canada and the U.S.A. respectively, the comparable data were: peritoneal dialysis, 32% and 17%; native fistula, 33% and 15%; PTFE, 19% and 41%; and central catheter 16% and 27%. These data suggest that the use of peritoneal dialysis may allow reduced use of non native AV fistula access without mortality penalty.');

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2020,16042764,'Numerous nonparametric approaches have been proposed in literature to detect differential gene expression in the setting of two user-defined groups. However, there is a lack of nonparametric procedures to analyze microarray data with multiple factors attributing to the gene expression. Furthermore, incorporating interaction effects in the analysis of microarray data has long been of great interest to biological scientists, little of which has been investigated in the nonparametric framework.In this paper, we propose a set of nonparametric tests to detect treatment effects, clinical covariate effects, and interaction effects for multifactorial microarray data. When the distribution of expression data is skewed or heavy-tailed, the rank tests are substantially more powerful than the competing parametric F tests. On the other hand, in the case of light or medium-tailed distributions, the rank tests appear to be marginally less powerful than the parametric competitors.The proposed rank tests enable us to detect differential gene expression and establish interaction effects for microarray data with various non-normally distributed expression measurements across genome. In the presence of outliers, they are advantageous alternative approaches to the existing parametric F tests due to the robustness feature.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2021,22863193,'We propose in this paper a unified approach for testing the association between rare variants and phenotypes in sequencing association studies. This approach maximizes power by adaptively using the data to optimally combine the burden test and the nonburden sequence kernel association test (SKAT). Burden tests are more powerful when most variants in a region are causal and the effects are in the same direction, whereas SKAT is more powerful when a large fraction of the variants in a region are noncausal or the effects of causal variants are in different directions. The proposed unified test maintains the power in both scenarios. We show that the unified test corresponds to the optimal test in an extended family of SKAT tests, which we refer to as SKAT-O. The second goal of this paper is to develop a small-sample adjustment procedure for the proposed methods for the correction of conservative type I error rates of SKAT family tests when the trait of interest is dichotomous and the sample size is small. Both small-sample-adjusted SKAT and the optimal unified test (SKAT-O) are computationally efficient and can easily be applied to genome-wide sequencing association studies.

A reliable biomarker to predict clinical outcome at diagnosis has not yet been identified. To date, pathological review of neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced necrosis is the most useful determinant of which patients are likely to develop metastatic disease. There is a clinical need to identify patients who will benefit from more aggressive preoperative therapy or perhaps require less aggressive chemotherapy. More than 30 human P450 isoenzymes have been characterized, with at least nine possessing some clinical relevance. One of these, CYP3A4/5 is involved in metabolic activation and detoxification of a wide number of carcinogens and chemotherapeutic agents, including many drugs that are useful in the treatment of osteosarcomas.Osteosarcoma tissue microarray blocks containing biopsies from 18 primary tumors were used to analyze the expression of P450s 1A1/2, 1B1, 2B6, 2D6, and 3A4/5 by enzyme-linked avidin-biotin complexed immunohistochemistry. The frequencies of expression were 83%, 67%, and 83% for P450s 1A1/2, 1B1, and 3A4/5, respectively. P450s 2B6 and 2D6 were not detectable.These results were extended by developing a fluorescent-based quantitative immunocytochemistry technique to assess the levels of CYP3A4/5 in 18 paraffin-embedded primary biopsy sections. Expression of CYP3A4/5 was found to be significantly higher in primary biopsies of patients who developed distant metastatic disease compared with biopsies from patients with nonmetastatic disease (P = 0.0004).High cytochrome P450 CYP3A4/5 expression may predict metastasis and poor prognosis in osteosarcomas. Its use as a biomarker of therapeutic response will have implications for the treatment of these tumors.');

We conducted a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluating the analgesic efficacy of smoking cannabis for neuropathic pain. Thirty-eight patients with central and peripheral neuropathic pain underwent a standardized procedure for smoking either high-dose (7%), low-dose (3.5%), or placebo cannabis. In addition to the primary outcome of pain intensity, secondary outcome measures included evoked pain using heat-pain threshold, sensitivity to light touch, psychoactive side effects, and neuropsychological performance. A mixed linear model demonstrated an analgesic response to smoking cannabis. No effect on evoked pain was seen. Psychoactive effects were minimal and well-tolerated, with some acute cognitive effects, particularly with memory, at higher doses.This study adds to a growing body of evidence that cannabis may be effective at ameliorating neuropathic pain, and may be an alternative for patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other drugs. However, the use of marijuana as medicine may be limited by its method of administration (smoking) and modest acute cognitive effects, particularly at higher doses.');

We used mixed-effect models to predict pulmonary function based on individual 24-hr urinary cadmium output, adjusted for age, height, time elapsed from the baseline, and smoking status. We assessed effect modification by smoking status.Among all subjects, a single log-unit increase in baseline urinary cadmium was inversely associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) percent predicted [beta = -7.56%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.59% to -1.53%]; forced vital capacity (FVC) percent predicted (beta = -2.70%; 95% CI -7.39% to 1.99%), and FEV(1)/FVC ratio (beta = -4.13%; 95% CI -7.61% to -0.66%).

However, as part of the University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study, residential properties in the lower peninsula of Michigan, USA, were identified that were located far enough from known sources of these compounds that the soil concentrations should have been at background levels and yet the toxic equivalent (TEQ) of some properties'' soil was greater than 2.5 standard deviations above the mean background level. In the three cases presented here from Midland/Saginaw Counties, the anomalously high-TEQ values were primarily due to the presence of polychlorinated dibenzofurans. Based on interviews with the residents and a comparison of soil congener profiles, it was deduced that these values resulted from anthropogenic soil movement from historically contaminated areas. In the cases from Jackson/Calhoun Counties, the unusually high-TEQ values were primarily due to polychlorinated biphenyls. In the case profiled here, it appears that the soil became contaminated through sandblasting to remove paint from the swimming pool. This study identified two mechanisms for soil contamination outside zones of industrial impact; thus, an assumption of background levels of soil contamination outside industrial zones may not be valid.');

However, mapping genes with epistatic effects and gene-environment interactions is a difficult problem because of relatively small sample sizes and very large parameter spaces for quantitative trait locus models that include such interactions. Here we present a nonparametric Bayesian method to map multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) by considering epistatic and gene-environment interactions. The proposed method is not restricted to pairwise interactions among genes, as is typically done in parametric QTL analysis. Rather than modeling each main and interaction term explicitly, our nonparametric Bayesian method measures the importance of each QTL, irrespective of whether it is mostly due to a main effect or due to some interaction effect(s), via an unspecified function of the genotypes at all candidate QTL. A Gaussian process prior is assigned to this unknown function. In addition to the candidate QTL, nongenetic factors and covariates, such as age, gender, and environmental conditions, can also be included in the unspecified function. The importance of each genetic factor (QTL) and each nongenetic factor/covariate included in the function is estimated by a single hyperparameter, which enters the covariance function and captures any main or interaction effect associated with a given factor/covariate. An initial evaluation of the performance of the proposed method is obtained via analysis of simulated and real data.');

Standard high-throughput genotyping technologies capture only a fraction of the total genetic variation. Recent efforts have shown that it is possible to "impute" with high accuracy the genotypes of SNPs that are not collected in the study provided that they are present in a reference data set which contains both SNPs collected in the study as well as other SNPs. We here introduce a novel HMM based technique to solve the imputation problem that addresses several shortcomings of existing methods. First, our method is adaptive which lets it estimate population genetic parameters from the data and be applied to model organisms that have very different evolutionary histories. Compared to previous methods, our method is up to ten times more accurate on model organisms such as mouse. Second, our algorithm scales in memory usage in the number of collected markers as opposed to the number of known SNPs. This issue is very relevant due to the size of the reference data sets currently being generated. We compare our method over mouse and human data sets to existing methods, and show that each has either comparable or better performance and much lower memory usage.

We evaluated racial differences in resection rates after adjustment for patient, tumor, and hospital characteristics using hierarchical logistic regression. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess racial differences in survival after adjusting for patient, tumor, and hospital characteristics, and receipt of surgery.Compared with white patients, black patients were less likely to undergo surgery for liver (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-0.83), lung (aOR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.69), pancreas (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41-0.70), and esophagus cancers (aOR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.99). Hospitals varied in their surgery rates among patients with potentially resectable disease. However, resection rates were consistently lower for black patients, regardless of the resection rate of the treating hospital. Although there were no racial differences in overall survival with liver and esophageal cancer, black patients experienced poorer survival for lung (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00-1.10) and pancreas cancer (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03-1.30). In both instances, there were no residual racial disparities in overall survival after adjusting for use of surgery.Black patients are less likely to undergo surgery after diagnosis of a poor prognosis cancer.

We also surveyed occupational and personal exposures to dental amalgam and dietary fish consumption, from which daily methylmercury (MeHg) intake was estimated. Log-transformed urine and hair levels were modeled in multivariable linear regression separately against respective exposure surrogates, and the effect modification of 13 MT SNPs on exposure was investigated.The mean mercury levels in urine (1.06 Î¼g/L) and hair (0.51 Î¼g/g) were not significantly different from the U.S. general population (0.95 Î¼g/L and 0.47 Î¼g/g, respectively).

Ninety-three consecutive patients with angiographic CAD and a mean LV ejection fraction of 0.25 who underwent cardiac PET studies for assessment of hypoperfused yet viable myocardium ("mismatch pattern") using N-13 ammonia and 18-F deoxyglucose were followed up for an average of 13.6 months. Fifty patients underwent medical treatment and 43 underwent revascularization. The Cox model analysis showed that the extent of mismatch had a negative effect (p = 0.02), whereas revascularization had a positive effect on survival (p = 0.04). The annual survival probability of patients with mismatch receiving medical therapy was lower than of those without mismatch (50 vs 92%, p = 0.007). Patients with mismatch who underwent revascularization had a higher survival rate than those treated medically (88 vs 50%, P = 0.03). The presence of mismatch also predicted improvement in heart failure symptoms after revascularization (p < 0.001).

However, the level of anti-HIV CTL activity was not correlated with the level of DR+CD38+ CD8+ cells, indicating that enumeration of this lymphocyte population by flow cytometry most likely will not be a useful surrogate for measuring functional CTL activity. Low levels of HIV-specific CTL activity, especially against gag, were correlated with lower CD4+ cells numbers, suggesting that the loss of CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity against HIV that has been reported to occur with advancing HIV disease progression may reflect in part the extent of CD4+ cell immunodeficiency in HIV-infected subjects.');

We, therefore, aimed to determine the degree to which these advances have resulted in improved outcomes such as survival of patient and graft.We analyzed the rates of death and graft failure among the 11,482 Canadians with end-stage renal disease who received a kidney transplant in 1981-98. Patients were followed from the date of transplantation to the date of graft failure, the date of death or the end of the observation period, namely, Dec. 31, 1998, depending on which was the earliest. Rate ratios for mortality and graft failure--ratios of the rate for each calendar period to the rate for the arbitrarily chosen reference period, 1981-85--were estimated with a piece-wise exponential model that adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, primary renal diagnosis, follow-up time and donor-organ source.The rates and adjusted rate ratios for death and graft failure decreased significantly and steadily over time. Relative to 1981-85, the adjusted mortality rate ratios were 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.89), 0.65 (95% CI 0.52-0.82) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.41-0.67) for 1986-89, 1990-94 and 1995-98 respectively, and the adjusted graft failure rate ratios were 0.68 (95% CI 0.60-0.78), 0.62 (95% CI 0.54-0.70) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.44-0.58) respectively. The decrease was mostly among the cadaveric-organ recipients. Calendar period was as important a predictor of outcome as well-known prognostic factors such as age and primary renal diagnosis.Decreases in mortality rates are probably related to refinements in patient management. Decreases in graft failure rates are probably the result of a combination of improved immunotherapy and better management of nonimmunologic conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia.');

The patients include 560 who received continuous course once-a-day therapy, 116 who received twice-a-day treatment, and 108 who received a once-a-day split course regimen. Both 2+ and 3+ complications were considered. Fifty-six patients developed either of these complications. The factors included in the analysis were site and size of the primary, total dose, fraction size, and treatment time. The linear-quadratic model was used to incorporate fraction size into the analysis. Proportional hazards analysis, which models the time to occurrence of the late complication, was used to quantify the joint influence of the above patient and fractionation variables on the incidence of late effects. The occurrence of the late effects was heterogeneous, with only a weak relationship to the patient and fractionation variables. The influence of the size of the primary was significant, with larger primaries associated with higher complication rates independent of fractionation variables. For oropharynx primary sites there was no significant effect of the fractionation variables. For larynx and hypopharynx, excluding T1-T2 true vocal cord, there was a significant effect of total dose and fraction size. The alpha/beta ratio was estimated to be 7.8 Gy (95% confidence interval, 3.0, infinity). There was no significant effect of overall treatment time. The estimated 2+ complication rate at 1 year from 68 Gy given in 2 Gy fractions in 50 days is 0.1% for T 1-2 vocal cord, 4.1% for T1-T2 supraglottic larynx, 3.8% for T3 supraglottic larynx and vocal cord, 14.9% for T4 supraglottic larynx, 6.7% for T1-T2 tonsil and soft palate, 7.6% for T3-T4 tonsil and soft palate, 7.0% for T1-T2 pyriform sinus and pharyngeal wall, and 13.0% for T3-T4 pyriform sinus and pharyngeal wall.');

The lean core muscle size was calculated using analytic morphomic techniques. The primary outcome measure was survival, whereas secondary outcomes included surgical complications and costs. Covariate adjusted outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariate cox regression, multivariate logistic regression, and generalized estimating equation methods.The mean follow-up was 2.3 years and 214 patients died during the observation period. The covariate-adjusted hazard ratio for lean core muscle area was 1.45 (P = 0.028), indicating that mortality increased by 45% per 1000 mm(2) decrease in lean core muscle area. When stratified into tertiles of core muscle size, the 1-year survival was 87% versus 95% for the smallest versus largest tertile, whereas the 3-year survival was 75% versus 91%, respectively (P < 0.003 for both comparisons). The estimated average risk of complications significantly differed and was 20.9%, 15.0%, and 12.3% in the lower, middle, and upper tertiles of lean core muscle area, respectively. Covariate-adjusted cost increased significantly by an estimated $10,110 per 1000 mm(2) decrease in core muscle size (P = 0.003).Core muscle size is an independent and potentially important preoperative risk factor.

We studied Th17 cells, the associated mechanisms, and clinical significance in 201 ovarian cancer patients. Tumor-infiltrating Th17 cells exhibit a polyfunctional effector T-cell phenotype, are positively associated with effector cells, and are negatively associated with tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells. Tumor-associated macrophages promote Th17 cells through interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), whereas tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells inhibit Th17 cells through an adenosinergic pathway. Furthermore, through synergistic action between IL-17 and interferon-gamma, Th17 cells stimulate CXCL9 and CXCL10 production to recruit effector T cells to the tumor microenvironment. The levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 are associated with tumor-infiltrating effector T cells. The levels of tumor-infiltrating Th17 cells and the levels of ascites IL-17 are reduced in more advanced diseases and positively predict patient outcome. Altogether, Th17 cells may contribute to protective human tumor immunity through inducing Th1-type chemokines and recruiting effector cells to the tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of Th17 cells represents a novel immune evasion mechanism. This study thus provides scientific and clinical rationale for developing novel immune-boosting strategies based on promoting the Th17 cell population in cancer patients.');

Electrocardiogram data were recorded continuously, and heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) metrics were derived. Extensive CAP characterization, including use of a Semicontinuous Elements in Aerosol Sampler (SEAS), was performed, and positive matrix factorization was applied to investigate source factors.Mean CAP exposure concentrations were 518 Î¼g/m(3) and 357 Î¼g/m(3) in the summer and winter, respectively. Significant reductions in the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) in the summer were strongly associated with cement/lime, iron/steel, and gasoline/diesel factors, whereas associations with the sludge factor and components were less consistent. In winter, increases in HR were associated with a refinery factor and its components. CAP-associated HR decreases in winter were linked to sludge incineration, cement/lime, and coal/secondary sulfate factors and most of their associated components. Specific relationships for increased root mean square of the standard deviation of successive normal-to-normal intervals (RMSSD) in winter were difficult to determine because of lack of consistency between factors and associated constituents.Our results indicate that specific modulation of cardiac function in Detroit was most strongly linked to local industrial sources.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2078,10378256,'Longitudinal studies of health effects often relate individuals'' biomarker levels to disease progression. Repeated measurements also provide an opportunity to assess within-individual biomarker variability, and it is reasonable to postulate that this measure might provide additional information about a particular outcome variable. Given the existing precedent for application of adjustment methods to account for measurement error in subject-specific average levels of a covariate, this concept motivates the application of such methods to incorporate variability as well. In this paper, we investigate the nature of the relationship between the decline of CD4 cell count induced by infection with human immunodeficiency virus, and CD4 level and variability prior to infection. We first describe the distribution of repeated CD4 measurements prior to infection using a model that accounts both for random average levels and random subject-specific variance components. Based on this model, we define true unobservable random variables that correspond to prior level and stability. We perform a linear regression analysis, using these latent variables as covariates, by means of a full maximum likelihood approach. We compare the resulting parameter estimates with those based on regressions employing sample-based estimates of pre-infection levels and variances, and empirical Bayes estimates of these quantities. Although the final inferences are similar to those based on the unadjusted analysis, we find that the magnitude of association with prior level decreases, while that with prior stability increases. Stratified analyses indicate that smoking status affects the relationship between prior CD4 level and initial CD4 decline. We point out advantages associated with the maximum likelihood approach in this particular application.');

We consider variance estimation in the setting where subjects are clustered and the study consists of a small number of moderate-to-large-sized clusters. We demonstrate through simulation that the robust estimator is quite inaccurate in this setting. We propose a corrected version of the robust variance estimator, as well as jackknife and bootstrap estimators.

In outbred populations, linkage disequilibrium is expected to operate over short distances and could provide a powerful fine-mapping tool. Here we build on recently developed methods for linkage-disequilibrium mapping of quantitative traits to construct a general approach that can accommodate nuclear families of any size, with or without parental information. Variance components are used to construct a test that utilizes information from all available offspring but that is not biased in the presence of linkage or familiality. A permutation test is described for situations in which maximum-likelihood estimates of the variance components are biased. Simulation studies are used to investigate power and error rates of this approach and to highlight situations in which violations of multivariate normality assumptions warrant the permutation test. The relationship between power and the level of linkage disequilibrium for this test suggests that the method is well suited to the analysis of dense maps. The relationship between power and family structure is investigated, and these results are applicable to study design in complex disease, especially for late-onset conditions for which parents are usually not available. When parental genotypes are available, power does not depend greatly on the number of offspring in each family. Power decreases when parental genotypes are not available, but the loss in power is negligible when four or more offspring per family are genotyped. Finally, it is shown that, when siblings are available, the total number of genotypes required in order to achieve comparable power is smaller if parents are not genotyped.');

Increasing evidence supports the association of aggressive triple-negative (TN) breast cancer with heightened expression of the Polycomb group protein Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) and increased tumor-initiating cells (TICs). However, mechanistic links between EZH2 and TICs are unclear, and direct demonstration of a tumorigenic function of EZH2 in vivo is lacking. Here, we identify an unrecognized EZH2/NOTCH1 axis that controls breast TICs in TN breast carcinomas. EZH2 overexpression increases NOTCH1 expression and signaling, and inhibition of NOTCH1 activity prevents EZH2-mediated stem cell expansion in nontumorigenic breast cells. We uncover a unique role of EZH2 in activating, rather than repressing, NOTCH1 signaling through binding to the NOTCH1 promoter in TN breast cancer cells. EZH2 binding is independent of its catalytic histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase activity and of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 but corresponds instead to transcriptional activation marks. In vivo, EZH2 knockdown decreases the onset and volume of xenografts derived from TN breast TICs. Conversely, transgenic EZH2 overexpression accelerates mammary tumor initiation and increases NOTCH1 activation in mouse mammary tumor virus-neu mice. Consonant with these findings, in clinical samples, high levels of EZH2 are significantly associated with activated NOTCH1 protein and increased TICs in TN invasive carcinomas.

These studies suggest that, although the case-only method generally has maximum power, it has the potential to create substantial false positives in large-scale studies even when a small fraction of markers are associated with the exposure under study in the underlying population. All the hybrid methods perform well in protecting against such false positives and yet can retain substantial power advantages over standard case-control tests. The authors conclude that, for future genome-wide scans for gene-environment interactions, major power gain is possible by using alternatives to standard case-control analysis.

Current ophthalmic examinations and the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire were obtained. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate the time-related probability of allograft rejection, graft failure, and KC recurrence. Cox regression was used to identify predictive factors of these outcomes. The 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire scores were summarized with descriptive statistics.Follow-up was available up to 27 years after surgery (median, 10 years). Rejection occurred in 98 ofÂ 219 grafts. Most rejections occurred in the first 2 years (probability, 41%; standard error, 3%). KC recurrence was noted in 6 grafts 9 to 20 years after surgery, with a 20-year probability of 10% (standard error, 4%). Eighteen grafts failed, with a 20-year probability of 12% (standard error, 3%). Larger host trephine size, male donor gender, and nonwhite donor race were associated with increased rejection hazard. Worse astigmatism and nonwhite recipient race were associated with increased failure hazard. Twenty-eight subjects completed the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire at an average of 23 years after surgery (range, 18 to 26 years).

After treatment initiation and early follow-up, patients received clinical and QOL evaluations at 6-month intervals. QOL assessments were administered by telephone at a centralized interviewing center.The CIGTS collected comprehensive QOL information that included both generic and vision-specific QOL measures. This article focuses on initial treatment group differences related to symptom reporting, as measured by a Symptom and Health Problem Checklist, and changes in daily visual functioning, as measured by the Visual Activities Questionnaire (VAQ).Across both treatment groups, there was an overall decline in the percent of participants reporting symptoms over time. Of 43 possible symptoms, 12 symptoms were reported with greater frequency by the surgically treated group and 7 symptoms more frequently by the medically-treated group. The surgical patients reported more total Symptom Impact Glaucoma (P = 0.005) and, in particular, more bother related to local eye symptoms. Very few treatment group differences were noted in visual functioning, although surgical patients reported more problems with activities related to their visual acuity (P = 0.024). The percentage of patients across treatment groups reporting worry about blindness was 50% at baseline but declined to approximately 25% over time.Overall, the QOL impact reported by the two treatment groups as measured by instruments used in this study is remarkably similar, with relatively few significant study group differences observed after up to 5 years of follow-up in the CIGTS. When significant differences in visual function have been detected using the VAQ, they are consistent with the clinical outcomes. To date, the most persistent QOL finding is the increased impact of local eye symptoms reported by the surgical group compared with the medical group. Although no changes are recommended in the treatment of newly diagnosed glaucoma patients at the time of this interim report, further follow-up will allow for more definitive answers to the QOL impact of these two treatment approaches.');

Historic exposures before 1980, including living in the Midland/Saginaw area, hunting and fishing in the contaminated areas, and working at Dow, contributed to serum dioxin levels. Exposures since 1980 in Midland and Saginaw counties contributed little to serum dioxins.This study provides valuable insights into the relationships between serum dioxins and environmental factors, age, sex, body mass index, smoking, and breast-feeding.

In an additional 18 xenografts, the immunohistochemically derived HIF-1 alpha protein distribution was compared with 18F-FAZA autoradiography. Animals were divided into groups breathing either room air or carbogen (95% oxygen, 5% CO2) for 4 h until sacrifice.Under room air conditions, roughly 60% of the tumor surface displayed a spatial coupling of 18F-FAZA and 125I-Gluco-RGD uptake: either high (Q1) or low (Q3) uptake for both tracers, with Q1 indicating spatial association of hypoxia and angiogenesis and Q3 indicating adequate oxygenation without active angiogenesis. However, the remaining approximately 40% of the tumor surface showed discordant 18F-FAZA and 125I-Gluco-RGD uptake, indicating that hypoxia and angiogenesis are not necessarily spatially linked to each other and highlighting substantial intratumoral heterogeneity of the 18F-FAZA and 125I-Gluco-RGD uptake. Although carbogen breathing conditions significantly decreased the mean 18F-FAZA tumor-to-muscle ratio, no significant changes were observed for 125I-Gluco-RGD, indicating that an acute increase in tumor oxygenation did not influence alpha v beta 3 integrin receptor expression. The HIF-1 alpha-positive (HIFpos) tumor cell fraction was not significantly influenced by breathing conditions and covered between 0% and 35% of the total tumor section surface.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2109,22415948,'Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are commonly used for the analysis of correlated data. However, use of quadratic inference functions (QIFs) is becoming popular because it increases efficiency relative to GEE when the working covariance structure is misspecified. Although shown to be advantageous in the literature, the impacts of covariates and imbalanced cluster sizes on the estimation performance of the QIF method in finite samples have not been studied. This cluster size variation causes QIF''s estimating equations and GEE to be in separate classes when an exchangeable correlation structure is implemented, causing QIF and GEE to be incomparable in terms of efficiency. When utilizing this structure and the number of clusters is not large, we discuss how covariates and cluster size imbalance can cause QIF, rather than GEE, to produce estimates with the larger variability. This occurrence is mainly due to the empirical nature of weighting QIF employs, rather than differences in estimating equations classes. We demonstrate QIF''s lost estimation precision through simulation studies covering a variety of general cluster randomized trial scenarios and compare QIF and GEE in the analysis of data from a cluster randomized trial.');

Tendon sheath fluid and tenosynovial changes have been demonstrated by imaging symptomatic patients who were treated with AIs. The authors hypothesized that these abnormalities are correlated with AIMSS.Thirty consecutive patients in whom adjuvant therapy with letrozole or exemestane was initiated on a prospective clinical trial enrolled in a pilot study evaluating tendon and joint abnormalities at baseline and after 3 months of AI therapy.

AIMSS were defined as an increase in the HAQ or VAS score during AI therapy that exceeded a predefined cutoff.Twenty-five patients completed both the baseline and 3-month assessments. During the first 12 months of AI therapy, 15 patients developed AIMSS, and 13 discontinued therapy because of musculoskeletal symptoms. There was a trend toward an association between the presence of tendon sheath abnormalities on wrist ultrasound at baseline and the development of AIMSS (P = .06).Clinically relevant musculoskeletal symptoms develop in women treated with AIs, leading to treatment discontinuation in a substantial percentage of these patients.

Study participants received clinical examinations and quality-of-life (QOL) evaluations at baseline and 6-month intervals. The QOL questionnaire was administered by trained telephone interviewers at a centralized interviewing center.The QOL questionnaire included an assessment of FOB, measures of vision-related functioning, and measures of general physical and psychosocial well being. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to assess clinical and QOL measures associated with FOB over time.After being told about the glaucoma diagnosis but before randomization, 34% of patients reported at least a moderate amount of FOB. This percent dropped to 11% at 5 years. In multivariable ordinal logistic regression models, younger age, being white, and having less education and a lower income were associated with increased FOB (all P<0.05). At the 36-month follow-up, visual field progression was associated significantly with increased FOB (P = 0.006); visual acuity loss, although related to increased FOB, did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.327). Self-reported visual function measures explained more of the variation in FOB over time than did demographic, clinical, or physical or psychosocial measures. Initial treatment assignment (medicine or surgery) was not associated with FOB. The most significant correlate over time with FOB was the perceived impact on an individual''s ability to perform visual tasks.More attention to reducing glaucoma patients'' FOB at diagnosis and over time is warranted. Fear of blindness over time is related more to how much an individual is bothered by their inability to perform visual tasks than to their monocular visual acuity or visual field assessments.');

Recent mortality comparisons of CAPD and HD.Mortality rate ratio (RR) based on "as-treated" (AT) analysis incorporating treatment modality switches and adjusting for age, primary renal diagnosis, and comorbid conditions using Poisson regression. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox regression and based on an "intent-to-treat" (ITT) analysis wherein patients were classified based on dialytic modality received on follow-up day 90.Adjusted mortality rates were significantly decreased on CAPD/CCPD relative to HD [RR = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (0.69, 0.77)] based on the AT analysis. Most of the protective effect of CAPD/CCPD was concentrated in the first 2 years of follow-up post-RRT initiation. Based on the ITT analysis, the estimated CAPD/ CCPD effect was greatly reduced, with HR = 0.93 (0.87, 0.99).We provide further evidence that CAPD/CCPD is not an inferior dialytic modality to HD, particularly in the short term. Comparing mortality rates on CAPD/CCPD and HD is inherently difficult due to the potential for bias.

We compiled a summertime daily weather and mortality counts dataset from four U.S. cities (Chicago, IL; Detroit, MI; Philadelphia, PA; and Phoenix, AZ) from 1998 to 2006. A variety of weather variables were ranked in predicting deviation from typical daily all-cause and cause-specific death counts. Ranks of weather variables varied with city and health outcome. Apparent temperature appeared to be the most important predictor of heat-related mortality for all-cause mortality. Absolute humidity was, on average, most frequently selected as one of the top variables for all-cause mortality and seven cause-specific mortality categories. Our analysis affirms that apparent temperature is a reasonable variable for activating heat alerts and warnings, which are commonly based on predictions of total mortality in next few days.

Unaffected child trios (UCTs) have also been proposed but mainly to rule out segregation distortion. To explore situations when UCTs are preferable to detect transmission distortion, we compared the number of UCTs and ACTs needed to achieve 80% power for a wide variety of scenarios. For a given genetic model, UCT sample size declined rapidly with increasing disease prevalence, whereas ACT sample size remained constant. Furthermore, at some prevalence value (40-60% depending on model parameters), detection of transmission distortion could be accomplished with fewer UCTs than ACTs. Such high prevalence may be found in special populations (diabetes among Pima Indians), secondary conditions (renal/retinal complications in diabetes), and pharmacogenetics (responders to treatment). Also, because exposure to an additional risk factor can increase the disease prevalence in an exposed sub-group, we explored how sample size requirements vary by exposure status. Whereas power differences between exposed and unexposed ACTs could be explained solely by genetic risk ratios, sub-group-specific disease prevalence also played an important role in UCTs. Finally, we considered the impact of including 5, 10, 20, or 30% misclassified ACTs in the UCT sample and found that a 24, 58, 180, or 550% larger sample would be required. In conclusion, UCTs can detect transmission distortion more effectively than ACTs when disease prevalence reaches 40-60%, although some efficiency may be lost owing to misclassification. Moreover, focusing on particular sub-groups defined by exposure status can potentially increase power, but such gains depend heavily on the nature of the gene-exposure interaction.');

The TCR alpha/delta locus on chromosome 14q contains many V, J and D segments that combine with constant domains to produce either an alpha or a delta chain of the T cell receptor. Multiple SNPs have been recognized within the V segments, and it has been suggested that variation within the locus may modify the course of autoimmune and allergic diseases. We have examined LD within an 850 kb section of the TCR alpha/delta locus on chromosome 14q by typing 24 V gene segment SNPs and two microsatellites. One hundred and fifty-nine nuclear and extended families were genotyped in order to derive haplotypes, and the pair-wise LD between SNPs was investigated in 600 haplotypes from unrelated individuals (the parents). The mean extent of useful LD was much greater than suggested by simulations: significant LD was relatively common at 250 kb and was detectable beyond 500 kb. The mean extent of LD was twice as far between alleles of low frequency than between common alleles. The distribution of LD was highly irregular and concentrated in three distinct islands. The results differ from those obtained by simulation, and if they are typical of other genomic regions, suggest that the minimum number of markers necessary for comprehensive LD mapping may be reduced by at least an order of magnitude.');

It is well known that the majority of these patients will ultimately die of their disease. Therefore, improvement of the standard treatment is clearly desirable. In the last years, high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) has been established as an effective salvage modality. A matched-pair analysis showed an advantage for HDCT compared with CDCT with an improvement in event-free and overall survival. Furthermore, due to increasing clinical experience in the management of side-effects, the use of peripheral blood progenitor cells and the availability of hematopoietic growth factors, HDCT has become relatively safe. Therefore, HDCT should be administered in patients with first relapse and unfavorable prognostic factors, and as second or subsequent salvage treatment followed by complete resections of tumor residuals. Patients with relapse or progressive disease after HDCT who do not qualify for desperation surgery could be salvaged with palliative chemotherapy combinations using gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and paclitaxel.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2139,23280596,'Prioritization is the process whereby a set of possible candidate genes or SNPs is ranked so that the most promising can be taken forward into further studies. In a genome-wide association study, prioritization is usually based on the P-values alone, but researchers sometimes take account of external annotation information about the SNPs such as whether the SNP lies close to a good candidate gene. Using external information in this way is inherently subjective and is often not formalized, making the analysis difficult to reproduce. Building on previous work that has identified 14 important types of external information, we present an approximate Bayesian analysis that produces an estimate of the probability of association. The calculation combines four sources of information: the genome-wide data, SNP information derived from bioinformatics databases, empirical SNP weights, and the researchers'' subjective prior opinions. The calculation is fast enough that it can be applied to millions of SNPS and although it does rely on subjective judgments, those judgments are made explicit so that the final SNP selection can be reproduced. We show that the resulting probability of association is intuitively more appealing than the P-value because it is easier to interpret and it makes allowance for the power of the study. We illustrate the use of the probability of association for SNP prioritization by applying it to a meta-analysis of kidney function genome-wide association studies and demonstrate that SNP selection performs better using the probability of association compared with P-values alone.');

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2142,16251462,'We use genotype data generated by the International HapMap Project to dissect the relationship between sequence features and the degree of linkage disequilibrium in the genome. We show that variation in linkage disequilibrium is broadly similar across populations and examine sequence landscape in regions of strong and weak disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium is generally low within approximately 15 Mb of the telomeres of each chromosome and noticeably elevated in large, duplicated regions of the genome as well as within approximately 5 Mb of centromeres and other heterochromatic regions. At a broad scale (100-1000 kb resolution), our results show that regions of strong linkage disequilibrium are typically GC poor and have reduced polymorphism. In addition, these regions are enriched for LINE repeats, but have fewer SINE, DNA, and simple repeats than the rest of the genome. At a fine scale, we examine the sequence composition of "hotspots" for the rapid breakdown of linkage disequilibrium and show that they are enriched in SINEs, in simple repeats, and in sequences that are conserved between species. Regions of high and low linkage disequilibrium (the top and bottom quartiles of the genome) have a higher density of genes and coding bases than the rest of the genome. Closer examination of the data shows that whereas some types of genes (including genes involved in immune response and sensory perception) are typically located in regions of low linkage disequilibrium, other genes (including those involved in DNA and RNA metabolism, response to DNA damage, and the cell cycle) are preferentially located in regions of strong linkage disequilibrium. Our results provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between sequence features and linkage disequilibrium and suggest an evolutionary justification for the heterogeneity in linkage disequilibrium in the genome.');

Given the emerging importance of the galanin cascade in regulating proliferation and survival, we investigated the effect of GAL on SCCHN progression via induction of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2)-mediated rap1 activation. Studies were performed in multiple SCCHN cell lines by inducing endogenous GALR2, by stably overexpressing GALR2 and by downregulating endogenous GALR2 with siGALR2. Cell proliferation and survival, mediated by the ERK and AKT signaling cascades, respectively, were evaluated by functional and immunoblot analysis. The role of rap1 in GALR2-mediated proliferation and survival was evaluated by modulating expression. Finally, the effect of GALR2 on tumor growth was determined. GALR2 stimulated proliferation and survival via ERK and AKT activation, respectively. Knockdown or inactivation of rap1 inhibited GALR2-induced, AKT and ERK-mediated survival and proliferation. Overexpression of GALR2 promoted tumor growth in vivo. GALR2 promotes proliferation and survival in vitro, and promotes tumor growth in vivo, consistent with an oncogenic role for GALR2 in SCCHN.');

Reviewers determined the origin of a mass, its tissue content (cystic, solid, complex cystic, or cystic and solid), tissue characteristics (fat, blood, fibrous, or leiomyomatous), and benignity versus malignancy. Sonograms were reviewed by three reviewers to determine the origin of a mass, its tissue content, and reasons for an indeterminate diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity of MRI were calculated, and agreement of sonography and MRI with the final diagnosis was determined using kappa statistics. The final diagnosis was determined by histopathology, surgical findings, or imaging or clinical follow-up.The sensitivity of MRI for identifying malignancy (n = 5) was 100% and its specificity for benignity (n = 90) was 94%. Excellent agreement was seen between MRI and the final diagnosis for determining the origin (kappa = 0.93), tissue content (kappa = 0.98), and tissue characteristics (kappa = 0.91) of a mass. Sonography had poor agreement with the final diagnosis for the origin (kappa = 0.19) and tissue content (kappa = 0.33) of a mass.

Bin ranks were weighted according to study size and summed across all studies; the summed rank (SR) for each bin was assessed empirically for significance using permutation methods. A high SR indicates a region with consistent evidence for linkage across studies. The strongest evidence for an AMD susceptibility locus was found on chromosome 10q26 where genome-wide significant linkage was observed (P=0.00025).

On multivariate analysis for DFS, COX-2, VEGF, and stage were significant (p = 0.012, p = 0.014, and p = 0.03, respectively), with increased expression indicating a worse prognosis. For OS, multivariate analysis revealed that VEGF, EGFR, and FIGO stage were significant (p = 0.005, p = 0.011, and p < 0.0001, respectively). Significant direct correlations were identified between VEGF and CD34 (p = 0.04), COX-2 and topo-II (p = 0.04), COX-2 and grade (p = 0.04), and tumor size and clinical stage (p = 0.04).Multivariate analysis revealed that increased staining for VEGF and COX-2 indicated diminished DFS, and VEGF and EGFR identified patients at increased risk of death. A significant direct correlation between VEGF and CD34 implicates the process of angiogenesis. Topo-II is a proliferative marker and it correlated directly with COX-2, indicating that expression of COX-2 may be greater in more proliferative tumors.

In contrast, under the assumption of gene-environment independence, modern "retrospective" methods, including the "case-only" approach, can estimate the interaction parameters much more precisely, but they can be seriously biased when the underlying assumption of gene-environment independence is violated. In this article, we propose a novel empirical Bayes-type shrinkage estimator to analyze case-control data that can relax the gene-environment independence assumption in a data-adaptive fashion. In the special case, involving a binary gene and a binary exposure, the method leads to an estimator of the interaction log odds ratio parameter in a simple closed form that corresponds to an weighted average of the standard case-only and case-control estimators. We also describe a general approach for deriving the new shrinkage estimator and its variance within the retrospective maximum-likelihood framework developed by Chatterjee and Carroll (2005, Biometrika92, 399-418). Both simulated and real data examples suggest that the proposed estimator strikes a balance between bias and efficiency depending on the true nature of the gene-environment association and the sample size for a given study.');

Patients underwent ultrasound-guided interscalene blocks using either 12 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine or 0.5% ropivacaine plus 150-Âµg dexmedetomidine. The primary outcomes were self-reported duration of the nerve block and safety assessment (adverse effects and neurological sequelae). Data were analyzed in a blinded fashion.The median duration of the nerve block was 18 hours (95% confidence interval, 18-20) in the dexmedetomidine group and 14 hours (95% confidence interval, 14-16) in the ropivacaine group (P = 0.0001). Dexmedetomidine also lowered pain scores for the first 14 hours postoperatively and significantly hastened the time to sensory (P = 0.04) and motor (P = 0.002) block onset. Dexmedetomidine lowered heart rate but blood pressures were stable. Plasma levels of ropivacaine were not different between groups, and plasma dexmedetomidine levels were relatively low. There were no adverse events or neurological sequelae.Dexmedetomidine added to ropivacaine for interscalene blocks increased the duration of the nerve block and improved postoperative pain. These additional efficacy and safety data should encourage further study of peripheral perineural dexmedetomidine in humans.');

We conducted genetic fine-mapping across the approximately 417-kb region of linkage disequilibrium spanning GCKR and 16 other genes on chromosome 2p23 by imputing untyped HapMap single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genotyping 104 SNPs across the associated genomic interval.We provide comprehensive evidence that GCKR rs780094 is associated with opposite effects on fasting plasma triglyceride (P(meta) = 3 x 10(-56)) and glucose (P(meta) = 1 x 10(-13)) concentrations. In addition, we confirmed recent reports that the same SNP is associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) level (P = 5 x 10(-5)).

Baseline values of HIV RNA plasma concentrations were significantly lower for women (0.3 log10) than men in a subset of patients in whom assays were taken and this difference persisted after adjustment for CD4+ count. Women reported reducing dosage and discontinue ddI-containing regimens more frequently than men did; adjustment for weight did not completely explain this difference. Women were at lower risk than men for progression to a study endpoint (19% of women versus 24% of men; p <.0001). Among those antiretroviral-naive study subjects receiving ZDV, men were four times more likely to progress to a study endpoint than women.Differences in pretreatment characteristics and on study experiences were demonstrated between women and men enrolled in this clinical trial.

Michigan driver records were obtained to examine offenses, serious offenses, driving offense points, crashes and serious crashes in the three pre-interview years. Multivariate regression analyses, adjusting for age, race, and marital status were conducted separately by sex to identify personality factors related to driving.For men and women, greater risk-taking propensity, physical/verbal hostility, aggression, and tolerance of deviance were significant predictors of a competitive attitude toward driving, risk-taking driving, high-risk driving, driving aggression, and drink/driving. Greater risk-taking propensity, physical/verbal hostility, aggression, and to a small degree, expectations for achievement predicted higher numbers of offenses, serious offenses, and points.Traffic safety policies and programs could be enhanced through recognition of the role personality factors play in driving behavior and the incorporation of this knowledge into the design and implementation of interventions that modify the behaviors associated with them.');

All subjects were between 30 and 50 years old, not taking oral contraceptives, and were studied during the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Circulating concentrations of ACTH and cortisol were measured in blood samples collected at frequent intervals from 2000 to 0800 hour. A submaximal dose of cosyntropin (0.01 microg/kg), a synthetic ACTH (1-24), was administered at 0800 hour to assess adrenocortical sensitivity. In a separate session, low-dose cosyntropin was also administered following high-dose dexamethasone (8 mg intravenous) to assess adrenocortical sensitivity in the relative absence of endogenous ACTH. In addition, the ACTH response to dexamethasone was measured to determine the pituitary glucocorticoid negative feedback. Sessions were 5 days apart, and blood draws were obtained every 5 to 10 minutes.Mean concentrations and pulsatile characteristics of ACTH and cortisol over 12 hours were not statistically different between the 2 groups. Healthy controls had a somewhat higher (p < 0.08) net peak, but not net integrated, cortisol response to cosyntropin relative to the alcohol-dependent women. There were no significant group differences in either the ACTH or cortisol response to dexamethasone nor in the net cortisol response to cosyntropin following dexamethasone.Significant differences in pituitary-adrenal function were not apparent between alcohol-dependent women and matched controls.

Summary measures of IOP control during follow-up included the maximum, mean, standard deviation (SD), range, proportion less than 16, 18, 20, or 22 mmHg, and whether all IOP values were less than each of these 4 cutpoints. Predictive models for VF outcomes were based on the mean deviation (MD) from VF testing, and were adjusted for age, gender, race, baseline VF loss, treatment, and time. Each summary IOP measure was included as a cumulative, time-dependent variable, and its association with subsequent VF loss was assessed from 3 to 9 years postrandomization. Both linear mixed models, to detect shifts in MD levels, and logistic models, to detect elevated odds of substantial worsening (â¥3 dB), were used.We measured the MD from Humphrey 24-2 full threshold VF tests.The effect of the summary IOP measures differed between the medicine and surgery groups in models that addressed the continuous MD outcome.

All registrations were implemented by user initialization of the approximate pose between the two data sets, followed by automatic optimization based on maximizing mutual information. Only the higher quality anatomical images were used in the registration process; however, the spatial transformation was directly applied to a quantitative diffusion image. Quantitative diffusion maps from the registered location appeared highly correlated with the H&E slide. Overall, this approach provides a robust method for coregistration of in vivo images with histological sections and will have broad applications in the field of functional and molecular imaging.');

We assessed long-term trends in surgeon adoption of laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and fit multilevel logistic regression models to estimate the association between surgeon or practice setting characteristics and patient receipt of laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.The annual proportion of patients receiving laparoscopic radical nephrectomy increased from 1.4% in 1995 to 44.9% in 2005 (p <0.001). In patients treated by recent medical school graduates (graduation year 1991 or thereafter) the likelihood of undergoing laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was more than 2-fold higher when urologists practiced at National Cancer Institute designated Cancer Centers (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.11-5.06) or in urban settings (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.10-7.75).

Salivary cortisol samples were collected six times per day over 3 days: at awakening, 30min later, at 1000h, noon, 1800h and at bedtime. Blacks and Hispanics had lower levels of wake-up cortisol and less steep early declines, while Blacks had flatter and Hispanics steeper late day declines relative to Whites. Similarly the low socioeconomic status group also had lower levels of wake-up cortisol and less steep decline during the early part of the day. These patterns remained after adjustment for health behaviors and psychosocial factors. This study finds an association between salivary cortisol and race/ethnicity and SES in a multi-ethnic study population.

In the current paper, we describe a computer simulation method to estimate the power of a proposed study to detect linkage for a complex genetic trait, given a hypothesized genetic model for the trait. Our method simulates trait locus genotypes consistent with observed trait phenotypes, in such a way that the probability to detect linkage can be estimated by sample statistics of the maximum lod score distribution. The method uses terms available when calculating the likelihood of the trait phenotypes for the pedigree and is applicable to any trait determined by one or a few genetic loci; individual-specific environmental effects can also be dealt with.

This imputation strategy has been successful for GWA studies in populations well represented by existing reference panels. We used genotypes at 513,008 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in 443 unrelated individuals from 29 worldwide populations to evaluate the "portability" of the HapMap reference panels for imputation in studies of diverse populations. When a single HapMap panel was leveraged for imputation of randomly masked genotypes, European populations had the highest imputation accuracy, followed by populations from East Asia, Central and South Asia, the Americas, Oceania, the Middle East, and Africa. For each population, we identified "optimal" mixtures of reference panels that maximized imputation accuracy, and we found that in most populations, mixtures including individuals from at least two HapMap panels produced the highest imputation accuracy. From a separate survey of additional SNPs typed in the same samples, we evaluated imputation accuracy in the scenario in which all genotypes at a given SNP position were unobserved and were imputed on the basis of data from a commercial "SNP chip," again finding that most populations benefited from the use of combinations of two or more HapMap reference panels.

A logistic regression model is proposed for the incidence part of the model, and a Kaplan-Meier type approach is used to estimate the latency part of the model. The estimator arises naturally out of the EM algorithm approach for fitting failure time mixture models as described by Larson and Dinse (1985).

Wide variations among countries were observed in risk of amputation, with the lowest prevalence in Japan and the highest in Belgium, France, and Germany. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as age, peripheral vascular disease, and smoking were predictive of amputation, as were such risk factors related to hemodialysis as altered mineral metabolism and years of hemodialysis therapy.

We use a two-stage approach to reduce the variability in the observed CD4 counts in order to obtain a more accurate estimate of the relative risk parameter and more valid summary statistics. In the first stage, population based smoothing methods derived from a random-effects model plus a stochastic process or individual based smoothing methods are used to replace the observed longitudinal CD4 counts with less variable imputes at each failure time. In the second stage, we use the imputes in a time-dependent Cox model to estimate the risk parameter and its associated summary statistics.

A similar scenario was observed in the multiple logistic analyses.Mexican Americans had periodontal health profiles closer to non-Hispanic Whites than did African Americans, despite the shared "minority" status. Public health research and practice should explicitly recognize that while "minorities" are considered a homogeneous group, they do not necessarily share the same health profiles.');

Using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF(TM)), we determined scores for 8 generic scale summaries derived from these scales, i.e., the physical component summary [PCS] and mental component summary [MCS], and 11 kidney disease- targeted scales. Regression models were used to adjust for differences in comorbidities and sociodemographic and treatment factors. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct P-values for multiple comparisons.Unemployment and psychiatric disease were independently and significantly associated with lower scores for all generic and several kidney disease-targeted HRQOL measures. Several other comorbidities, lower educational level, lower income, and hypoalbuminemia were also independently and significantly associated with lower scores of PCS and/or MCS and several generic and kidney disease-targeted scales. Hemodialysis by catheter was associated with significantly lower PCS scores, partially explained by the correlation with covariates.Associations of poorer HRQOL with preventable or controllable factors support a greater focus on psychosocial and medical interventions to improve the well-being of hemodialysis patients.');

The main outcome measures were rating of risk and prevalence of witnessing driving hazards.Drinking while driving was ranked as the greatest hazard (87% of the respondents reported that it made a lot of difference), although only 12% witnessed it often. Ranked next as dangers while driving were text-messaging, racing, impairment from marijuana, and road rage. Sixty percent viewed inexperience as a significant hazard, although only 15% reported seeing it often. Cell phone use was viewed as a significant hazard by 28%, although 57% witnessed it frequently. Only 10% viewed peer passengers as hazardous, but 64% frequently observed them. Distracting peer behaviors, among other distractions, were viewed as more dangerous.

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2213,11443732,'Multipoint lod scores are typically calculated for a grid of locus positions, moving the putative disease locus across a fixed map of genetic markers. Changing the order of a set of markers and/or the distances between the markers can make a substantial difference in the resulting lod score curve and the location and height of its maximum. The typical approach of using the best maximum likelihood marker map is not easily justified if other marker orders are nearly as likely and give substantially different lod score curves. To deal with this problem, we propose three weighted multipoint lod score statistics that make use of information from all plausible marker orders. In each of these statistics, the information conditional on a particular marker order is included in a weighted sum, with weight equal to the posterior probability of that order. We evaluate the type 1 error rate and power of these three statistics on the basis of results from simulated data, and compare these results to those obtained using the best maximum likelihood map and the map with the true marker order. We find that the lod score based on a weighted sum of maximum likelihoods improves on using only the best maximum likelihood map, having a type 1 error rate and power closest to that of using the true marker order in the simulation scenarios we considered.');

Using data obtained from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register, the 17,900 patients who received PD during the 1981 to 1997 period were studied. Mortality and TF rate ratios (RR) were estimated using Poisson regression, adjusting for age, gender, race, primary renal diagnosis, province, follow-up time, and type of PD.As the cumulative number of PD patients treated increased, covariate-adjusted mortality significantly decreased (P < 0.05); a weaker yet significant association was observed between number of PD patients treated and TF. As the percentage of patients initiating dialysis on PD increased, TF rates decreased significantly. No association was observed between center academic status and PD mortality or TF rates.These results imply that a center''s experience with and degree of specialization toward PD impact strongly on PD outcomes. One hypothesis is that a center''s propensity to exploit technical and non-technical advances in PD increases directly with these variables. It is also possible that, through experience, centers become more adept at identifying appropriate patients to receive PD. More detailed research is required to evaluate these hypotheses.');

We explicitly relate power and cost through the number of measures for different designs. Based on these models, we derive general formulas for optimal number of repeated measures for a given power or cost and use analytical calculations and simulations to compare power for different numbers of repeated measures across several scenarios. We give rigorous proof for the results under the balanced design.Repeated measures substantially improve power and the proportional increase in LOD score depends mostly on measurement error and total heritability but not much on marker map, the number of alleles per marker or family structure. When measurement error takes up 20% of the trait variability and 4 measures/subject are taken, the proportional increase in LOD score ranges from 38% for traits with heritability of approximately 20% to 63% for traits with heritability of approximately 80%.

The frequency and intensity of summer heat waves will continue to increase as a result of climate change. It is important that we understand the environmental and structural factors that increase heat vulnerability, as well as examine the behaviors used by the elderly to adapt to hot indoor temperatures.From June 1 to August 31, 2009, residents in 29 homes in Detroit, MI, kept an hourly log of eight heat-adaptive behaviors: opening windows/doors, turning fans or the air conditioner on, changing clothes, taking a shower, going to the basement, the porch/yard, or leaving the house. Percentages of hourly behavior were calculated, overall and stratified by housing type and percent surface imperviousness. The frequency of behavior use, as a result of indoor and outdoor predetermined temperature intervals was compared to a reference temperature range of 21.1-23.8Â°C.The use of all adaptive behaviors, except going to the porch or yard, was significantly associated with indoor temperature. Non-mechanical adaptations such as changing clothes, taking showers, and going outside or to the basement were rarely used. Residents living in high-rises and highly impervious areas reported a higher use of adaptive behaviors. The odds of leaving the house significantly increased as outdoor temperature increased.These findings suggest that the full range of heat adaptation measures may be underused by the elderly and public health interventions need to focus on outreach to these populations.');

Of the 12,655 randomly selected housing units, 10,695 were occupied and 9781 were successfully contacted (91.5%). There were 1386 families with eligible children in the contacted households; and of those, 1021 were interviewed and examined at a permanent examination center organized for this study. This represents an overall response rate of 73.7%. At the center, trained staff interviewed the main caregivers of the selected children, and trained and calibrated dentists examined the caregiver and her/his child. Data used in this study included information gathered from the social, behavioral and parenting questionnaires, the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire (total sugar intake), and data collected from community and census databases.Over 90% of the adults (ages 14-70 years, average 29.3) had at least one noncavitated carious lesion and 82.2% had at least one primary cavitated lesion. Negative binomial regression models found that the age of caregivers and the number of churches in neighborhoods were negatively associated with the number of noncavitated tooth surfaces. Cavitated tooth surfaces were positively associated with age, oral hygiene status, being worried about teeth, a recent visit to a dentist, and the number of grocery stores in the neighborhoods. However, the number of cavitated tooth surfaces was negatively associated with preventive dental visits, positive rating of oral health status and the number of dentists in a community.Dental caries, especially at the noncavitated stage, is highly prevalent in low-income African-American adults in Detroit. A significant increase in the mean number of missing teeth was observed after the age of 34 years.

Patients were stratified by the presence or absence of metastatic disease. End points were overall survival (OS), 1-year disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity.The study group consisted of 79 patients (52 patients with localized disease and 27 patients with metastases). Both groups were well-balanced with respect to known prognostic factors. There was no significant difference in 1-year DFS comparing SD ifosfamide with HD ifosfamide (55% v 52%; P = .81). For SD ifosfamide, 2- and 3-year OS were 73% and 52% versus 57% and 49% for HD ifosfamide (P = .34).

There were five early deaths, all on the HD ifosfamide arm.When combined with doxorubicin, HD ifosfamide did not improve 1-year DFS and OS. Toxicity was clearly greater with the HD ifosfamide arm, and lack of outcome differences might be explained by toxicities with HD ifosfamide.

Data were collected from subjects prior to the start of their workshift. Participants completed questionnaires about diet, alcohol use, lifestyle, noise annoyance, use of hearing protection, noise exposure outside of the work environment, personal and family health histories, and demographic information. Resting blood pressure, heart rate, and body mass index were obtained. Noise exposure levels were extracted retrospectively from company records for each participant for the past 5 yr. Summary statistics were generated for each variable, and the authors performed bivariate correlations to identify any unadjusted associations. The authors then completed statistical modeling to investigate the effects of noise on blood pressure and heart rate, after they controlled for other variables (e.g., gender, race, age). The authors controlled for confounding variables, after which use of hearing protection in high-noise areas was a significant predictor of a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures.

Here, we show that a multiplex panel of urine transcripts outperforms PCA3 transcript alone for the detection of prostate cancer. We measured the expression of seven putative prostate cancer biomarkers, including PCA3, in sedimented urine using quantitative PCR on a cohort of 234 patients presenting for biopsy or radical prostatectomy. By univariate analysis, we found that increased GOLPH2, SPINK1, and PCA3 transcript expression and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status were significant predictors of prostate cancer. Multivariate regression analysis showed that a multiplexed model, including these biomarkers, outperformed serum PSA or PCA3 alone in detecting prostate cancer. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.758 for the multiplexed model versus 0.662 for PCA3 alone (P = 0.003). The sensitivity and specificity for the multiplexed model were 65.9% and 76.0%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 79.8% and 60.8%, respectively.

The subjects were a cohort of 790 male and female workers who participated in the intervention trial and responded to both the baseline and the 18-month follow-up surveys.

The results indicate that participants who were responsible for earning most or all of the money to support the household ate more servings of fruits and vegetables per day at 18-month follow-up than those without this responsibility. Further, those responsible for earning about half ate fewer servings of red meat than those responsible for earning most or all of the money to support the household. The results for red meat consumption differed by sex, such that responsibility for more than half or less than half of the money to support the household had different effects for men and women.

The mean follow-up was 34 months (range 1.5 to 75). We included men with Gleason score 7 (4 + 3) with those men with Gleason score 8 to 10 for racial/ethnic comparisons.AAM and white men diagnosed with organ-confined PCa demonstrated similar prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason grade, and biochemical recurrence. However, AAM diagnosed with non-organ-confined disease demonstrated higher PSA levels and a higher incidence of recurrence than did white men with non-organ-confined disease. There was a trend toward AAM having a greater proportion of high-grade lesions than white men when PCa was not organ confined. The evidence suggests that the difference in recurrence among AAM versus white men is based on pretreatment PSA, grade, extracapsular extension, and positive surgical margins. Seminal vesicle invasion predicted a worse prognosis equally for both AAM and white men.A difference in biochemical recurrence was not detected between AAM and white men with organ-confined PCa after radical prostatectomy. PSA was higher in AAM than in white men with pathologically locally advanced PCa, and the biochemical recurrence was greater. AAM had a greater percentage of high Gleason grade lesions compared with white men, and this difference approached statistical significance.

The stochastic process used in this paper is the multivariate integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, which includes Brownian motion and a random effects model as special limiting cases.

The model allows us to investigate the relationship between CD4 and beta-2-microglobulin through the correlations between their random effects and their serial correlation. The data suggest that CD4 and beta-2-microglobulin follow a bivariate Brownian motion process.

External validation is a more rigorous procedure necessary for evaluating whether the predictive model will generalize to populations other than the one on which it was developed.

Although the ordinary regression calibration (ORC) approach is approximately valid and efficient for measurement error correction of relative risk estimates from the Cox model with time-independent point exposures when the disease is rare, it is not adaptable for use with time-varying exposures. By recalibrating the measurement error model within each risk set, a risk set regression calibration (RRC) method is proposed for this setting. An algorithm for a bias-corrected point estimate of the relative risk using an RRC approach is presented, followed by the derivation of an estimate of its variance, resulting in a sandwich estimator. Emphasis is on methods applicable to the main study/external validation study design, which arises in important applications.

Controls (n = 4164) were a stratified random sample of enrollees defined by calendar year, age, sex, and prior heart disease. Clinical depression was defined as physician diagnosis of depression or use of antidepressant treatment within the year before the event. Referral to mental health clinics or hospitalization for depression defined severe depression.Clinically depressed patients had a higher odds ratio (OR) of CA (1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-2.23), which persisted after adjustment for confounders (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.18-1.73). The association was observed in both sexes, in various age groups, and in subjects with prior physician-diagnosed heart disease (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01-1.60) and without prior physician-diagnosed heart disease (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.22-2.41) (P = .13 for the interaction). Compared with nondepressed subjects, the risk of CA was increased in less severely depressed subjects (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.63) and further increased in severely depressed subjects (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.28-2.45) (P<.001 for trend).Clinical depression may be associated with a higher risk of CA independently of established coronary heart disease risk factors.');

However, the supply of kidneys is far short of the fast-growing demand. Kidney paired donation (KPD) programs provide an innovative approach for increasing the number of available kidneys. In a KPD program, willing but incompatible donor-candidate pairs may exchange donor organs to achieve mutual benefit. Recently, research on exchanges initiated by altruistic donors (ADs) has attracted great attention because the resultant organ exchange mechanisms offer advantages that increase the effectiveness of KPD programs. Currently, most KPD programs focus on rule-based strategies of prioritizing kidney donation. In this paper, we consider and compare two graph-based organ allocation algorithms to optimize an outcome-based strategy defined by the overall expected utility of kidney exchanges in a KPD program with both incompatible pairs and ADs. We develop an interactive software-based decision support system to model, monitor, and visualize a conceptual KPD program, which aims to assist clinicians in the evaluation of different kidney allocation strategies. Using this system, we demonstrate empirically that an outcome-based strategy for kidney exchanges leads to improvement in both the quantity and quality of kidney transplantation through comprehensive simulation experiments.');

The authors used pairwise odds ratios to quantify behavior comorbidity at the individual and neighborhood levels. Risk behaviors co-occurred within individuals at specific points in time: antisocial behavior and substance use were 3.37 times more likely to co-occur within an individual at wave 1, as compared with the co-occurrence of any 2 behaviors from different individuals, while substance use and police problems were 2.94 times more likely to co-occur than substance use and antisocial behavior at wave 2. The authors also evaluated sequential comorbidity. Antisocial behavior was sequentially comorbid with substance use and police problems: 31% of youths who had reported antisocial behavior at baseline reported police problems or drug use at wave 2. These models can prove instrumental in answering the persistent questions about possible sequential relations among problem behaviors.');

SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND DESIGN: Data were from the Alameda County Study (California) and pertained to people aged 17-94 years (n = 6,627) in 1965 (baseline). Socioeconomic position (SEP) in childhood was based on respondent''s reports of their father''s occupation, and life course disadvantage was measured by cross-classifying childhood SEP and the respondent''s education and household income in 1965. The health outcomes were all-cause mortality (n = 2,420) and functional limitation measured using the Nagi index (n = 453, 17.4% of those alive in 1994). Relationships were examined before and after adjustment for changed socioeconomic circumstances after 1965.Those from a low SEP in childhood, and those exposed to a greater number of episodes of disadvantage over the life course before 1965, were subsequently more likely to die, to report functional limitation and to experience the greatest health-related burden.All-cause mortality, functional limitation and overall health-related burden in middle and late adulthood are shaped by socioeconomic conditions experienced during childhood and cumulative disadvantage over the life course.

Age at first diagnosis of invasive melanoma was slightly lower in the high-familial-risk group (57 v 60 years; P = .03). High-familial-risk subjects had more melanomas diagnosed at age 30 or younger (12% v 6%; P < .001).

The difference in variance for BMI among individuals with opposite homozygous genotypes at the FTO locus is approximately 7%, corresponding to a difference of â¼0.5âkilograms in the standard deviation of weight. Our results indicate that genetic variants can be discovered that are associated with variability, and that between-person variability in obesity can partly be explained by the genotype at the FTO locus. The results are consistent with reported FTO by environment interactions for BMI, possibly mediated by DNA methylation.

Nodule margin was recorded as smooth, lobulated, or spiculated. Volume was calculated from diameter measurements.

A semiautomated contouring program was used to define anatomically like bronchi and axial lung sections from the different physiologic sequences, from which automated measurements of area, shape, and attenuation were made.

Secondary outcomes of visual acuity (VA), IOP, and cataract were also studied.On the basis of completed follow-up through 4 years and partially completed through 5 years, VF loss did not differ significantly by initial treatment. Over the entire period of follow-up, surgical patients had a greater risk of substantial VA loss compared with medical patients. However, by 4 years after treatment, the average VA in the two groups was about equal. Over the course of follow-up, IOP in the medicine group has averaged 17 to 18 mmHg, whereas that in the surgery group averaged 14 to 15 mmHg. The rate of cataract requiring removal was greater in the surgically treated group.Both initial medical or initial surgical therapy result in about the same VF outcome after up to 5 years of follow-up. VA loss was greater in the surgery group, but the differences between groups seem to be converging as follow-up continues.

The initial phase of the study was conducted in 1996-1997 in two stages: an interviewer-administered survey followed by a clinical examination. The response rate in the clinical examination phase was 52%. Thus, some data were missing for clinical examination variables, diminishing the generalizability of the results to the general population. This paper is a case study demonstrating the application of multiple imputation to address important questions related to prostate cancer and urologic symptoms in a data set with missing values. On the basis of the observed clinical examination data, the American Urological Association Symptoms Score showed a surprising reduction in symptoms in the oldest age group, but after multiple imputation there was a monotonically increasing trend with age. It appeared that multiple imputation corrected for nonresponse bias associated with the observed data. For other outcome measures-namely, the age-adjusted 95th percentile of prostate-specific antigen level and the association between urologic symptoms and prostate volume-results from the observed data and the multiply imputed data were similar.');

Common situations that prompted VCPs to ask patients about driving included poor visual function, inquiries from the patient or family, and requests from the state. Visual acuity and peripheral vision testing were frequently relied on (performed always or often by >80% of VCPs), but other ocular test results and nonocular information were infrequently obtained. Questioning about night driving, reading road signs, and experiencing glare were frequent, but inquiries about driving tasks (eg, making left turns) were infrequent. The likelihood of asking about specific driving tasks was significantly greater with more time in practice and with a higher percentage of older patients in their practice, and the likelihood was significantly less for ophthalmologist specialists vs optometrists.Vision care providers are often placed in a primary role of advising older patients about their ability to drive safely or legally. The most frequent tests they use fail to capture the complexities of visual function that contribute to safe driving.

To test the hypothesis that low-dose prednisone might influence the efficacy of the cytotoxic regimen used, the toxicity profiles of the two treatment regimens and the patterns of treatment failure (relapse, second malignancy, or death) were examined.491 premenopausal and perimenopausal patients with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes included in International (Ludwig) Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) trial I from 1978 to 1981 and randomized to receive CMF or CMFp were analyzed for differences in long-term outcome and toxic events.

An adenoviral vector encoding, either the human IL-1ra gene (AdRSVIL-1ra) or the LacZ gene (AdRSVlacZ) or normal saline, were injected into the right lateral ventricles of adult CD-1 mice (n=96). Five days later, the mice received 1 h temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMACAO) followed by 23 h reperfusion. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), infarct volume, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and the number of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 positive vessels were measured to determine the effect of IL-1beta during postischemic reperfusion. Infarct volume in the AdRSVIL-1ra-transduced mice was markedly reduced compared to the AdRSVlacZ-transduced and saline-injected mice (36.0+/-5.3 mm(3) vs. 60.0+/-6.2 mm(3), 69. 5+/-6.3 mm(3), after 23 h of reperfusion, n=6-8 per group, p<0.05).

Our studies demonstrated that overexpression of IL-1ra in the mouse brain can downregulate intracellular adhesion molecule-1 expression both in the cortex and basal ganglia, which suggests that IL-1beta may play an important role in the activation of the inflammatory response during focal cerebral ischemia by promoting leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells.

The reported effects of adenosine A3 receptor stimulation appear to depend on the pattern of drug administration (acute vs. chronic), dose, and type of the target tissue. Thus, while acute exposure to A3 receptor agonists protects against myocardial ischemia, it is severely damaging when these agents are given shortly prior to cerebral ischemia. Mast cells degranulate when their A3 receptors are stimulated. Degranulation of neutrophils is, on the other hand, impaired. While reduced production of reactive nitrogen species has been reported following activation of A3 receptors in collagen-induced arthritis, the process appears to be enhanced in cerebral ischemia. Indeed, immunocytochemical studies indicate that both pre- and postischemic treatment with A3 receptor antagonist dramatically reduces nitric oxide synthase in the affected hippocampus. Even more surprisingly, low doses of A3 receptor agonists seem to enhance astrocyte proliferation, while high doses induce their apoptosis. This review concentrates on the studies of cerebral A3 receptors and, based on the available evidence, discusses the possibility of adenosine A3 receptor serving as an integral element of the endogenous cerebral neuroprotective complex consisting of adenosine and its receptors.');

Double-labeled immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that the neurons and astrocytes expressed ERK1, ERK2, p38, and SAPK/JNK during the early time points after MCAO. The current results demonstrate that brain damage after ischemia rapidly triggers time-dependent ERK1, ERK2, p38, and SAPK/ JNK phosphorylation, and reveals that neurons and astrocytes are involved in the activation of the MAPK pathway.

ELISA and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect the expression of MCP-1 protein after 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 12 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days of middle cerebral artery occlusion (n=3-5 in each group). Double-labeled fluorescent staining was used to examine the cellular localization of MCP-1.

MCP-1 expression peaked at 2 days and 3 days, and gradually decreased after 5 days of MCAO. Double-labeled immunostaining for MCP-1 and neuron specific enolase (NSE) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed that MCP-1 positive neurons were observed as early as 12 h of ischemia, while MCP-1 positive astrocytes were observed after 2 days of ischemia.

Among the top susceptibility variants, we identified an enrichment of cis regulatory loci on mRNA expression (eQTLs), and a significant excess of quantitative trait loci for DNA CpG methylation, hereafter referred to as methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). Bipolar disorder susceptibility variants that cis regulate both cerebellar expression and methylation of the same gene are a very small proportion of bipolar disorder susceptibility variants. This finding suggests that mQTLs and eQTLs provide orthogonal ways of functionally annotating genetic variation within the context of studies of pathophysiology in brain.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) live in a number of environments suggesting an ability to rapidly adapt to new environments. If UPEC are more adaptive than commensal E. coli we would expect that UPEC would have fewer CRISPR loci, and--if loci are present--that they would harbor fewer spacers than CRISPR loci in fecal E. coli. We tested this in vivo by comparing the number of CRISPR loci and spacers, and sensitivity to antibiotics (resistance is often obtained via plasmids) among 81 pairs of UPEC and fecal E. coli isolated from women with urinary tract infection. Each pair included one uropathogen and one commensal (fecal) sample from the same female patient. Fecal isolates had more repeats (p=0.009) and more unique spacers (p<0.0001) at four CRISPR loci than uropathogens. By contrast, uropathogens were more likely than fecal E. coli to be resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, no consistent association between CRISPRs and antibiotic resistance was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare fecal E. coli and pathogenic E. coli from the same individuals, and to test the association of CRISPR loci with antibiotic resistance.

Power can be increased by selecting cases that are highly likely to carry risk variants. As rare variants that contribute to the heritability of a disease co-segregate among affected family members, selecting cases that have affected family members may increase the power of rare variant tests considerably. Here I compare sequencing random cases to cases ascertained to have affected family members. I quantify the power of the different approaches and provide criteria for sample selection under different models of inheritance. Under a model of multiplicative gene-gene interaction, a sample of random cases has to be 2-16-fold larger to achieve the same power as a sample of cases ascertained to have affected family members. However, in traits with high heritability this power gain can be reduced or even reversed under models of additive gene-gene interaction. Hence study designs should depend on the studied disease''s heritability and on the available sample size.

To provide a basis for exploring how properties of the reference panel affect imputation accuracy theoretically rather than with computationally intensive imputation experiments, we introduce a coalescent model that considers imputation accuracy in terms of population-genetic parameters. Our model allows us to investigate sampling designs in the frequently occurring scenario in which imputation targets and templates are sampled from different populations. In particular, we derive expressions for expected imputation accuracy as a function of reference panel size and divergence time between the reference and target populations. We find that a modestly sized "internal" reference panel from the same population as a target haplotype yields, on average, greater imputation accuracy than a larger "external" panel from a different population, even if the divergence time between the two populations is small. The improvement in accuracy for the internal panel increases with increasing divergence time between the target and reference populations. Thus, in humans, our model predicts that imputation accuracy can be improved by generating small population-specific custom reference panels to augment existing collections such as those of the HapMap or 1000 Genomes Projects. Our approach can be extended to understand additional factors that affect imputation accuracy in complex population-genetic settings, and the results can ultimately facilitate improvements in imputation study designs.');

This broad peak is in a relative gene desert over an unknown EST and between the SLITRK1 and SLITRK6 genes. Evidence for association to this region came predominantly from subjects in the sample that were originally collected as part of a family-based bipolar linkage study, rather than those collected as bipolar singletons. We then genotyped an additional sample of bipolar singleton cases and controls, and the analysis of irritable vs. elated mania in this new sample did not replicate our previous findings. However, this lack of replication is likely due to the presence of significant differences in terms of clinical co-morbity that were identified between these singleton bipolar cases and those that were selected from families segregating the disorder. Despite these clinical differences, analysis of the combined sample provided continued support for 13q31 and other regions from our initial analysis. Though genome-wide significance was not achieved, our results suggest that irritable mania results from a distinct set of genes, including a region on chromosome 13q31.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2307,23746547,'Exome sequencing offers the potential to study the population-genomic variables that underlie patterns of deleterious variation. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are long stretches of consecutive homozygous genotypes probably reflecting segments shared identically by descent as the result of processes such as consanguinity, population size reduction, and natural selection. The relationship between ROH and patterns of predicted deleterious variation can provide insight into the way in which these processes contribute to the maintenance of deleterious variants. Here, we use exome sequencing to examine ROH in relation to the distribution of deleterious variation in 27 individuals of varying levels of apparent inbreeding from 6 human populations. A significantly greater fraction of all genome-wide predicted damaging homozygotes fall in ROH than would be expected from the corresponding fraction of nondamaging homozygotes in ROH (p < 0.001). This pattern is strongest for long ROH (p < 0.05). ROH, and especially long ROH, harbor disproportionately more deleterious homozygotes than would be expected on the basis of the total ROH coverage of the genome and the genomic distribution of nondamaging homozygotes. The results accord with a hypothesis that recent inbreeding, which generates long ROH, enables rare deleterious variants to exist in homozygous form. Thus, just as inbreeding can elevate the occurrence of rare recessive diseases that represent homozygotes for strongly deleterious mutations, inbreeding magnifies the occurrence of mildly deleterious variants as well.');

However, sequencing large samples remains very expensive. For a study sample with existing genotype data, such as array data from genome-wide association studies, a cost-effective approach is to sequence a subset of the study sample and then to impute the rest of the study sample, using the sequenced subset as a reference panel. The use of such an internal reference panel identifies population-specific variants and avoids the problem of a substantial mismatch in ancestry background between the study population and the reference population. To efficiently select an internal panel, we introduce an idea of phylogenetic diversity from mathematical phylogenetics and comparative genomics. We propose the "most diverse reference panel", defined as the subset with the maximal "phylogenetic diversity", thereby incorporating individuals that span a diverse range of genotypes within the sample. Using data both from simulations and from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that the most diverse reference panel can substantially improve the imputation accuracy compared to randomly selected reference panels, especially for the imputation of rare variants. The improvement in imputation accuracy holds across different marker densities, reference panel sizes, and lengths for the imputed segments.

Alcohol abuse (AA) and alcohol dependence (AD) are familial in BP families, and these families may carry a specific risk variant for BP.

Proposed pooling methods can be limited because they generally assume high-quality genotypes derived from deep-coverage sequencing, which may not be available.

More specifically, we compare the influence that a constant population size or an exponentially growing population has on the amount of LD. These results indicate that attempts to locate single disease genes are most likely successful in small and constant populations. On the other hand, if we consider an exponentially growing population that started to expand from an initially constant population of reasonable size, then our simulations indicate a lower success rate. The power to detect association is enhanced if haplotypes constructed from several SNPs are used as markers. The versatility of the coalescence approach also allows the analysis of other relevant factors that influence the chances that a disease gene will be located. We show that several alleles leading to the same disease have no substantial influence on the amount of LD, as long as the differences between the disease-causing alleles are confined to the same region of the gene locus and as long as each allele occurs in an appreciable frequency. Our simulations indicate that mapping of less-frequent diseases is more likely to be successful.

Fatigue was defined as a reduction in velopharyngeal closure force across the series of /si/ productions, as evidenced by a negatively sloped regression line fit to the closure force data.Absolute levels of velopharyngeal closure force were much lower than those observed previously in speakers without palatal clefts. All subjects showed evidence of fatigue. Furthermore, all subjects demonstrated exhaustion, where they were unable to close the velopharyngeal port against the nasal pressure load. This occurred at pressure load levels lower than those successfully completed by speakers without cleft palate.In speakers with a repaired palatal cleft, the velopharyngeal closure muscles may not possess the same strength and/or endurance as in normal speakers. Alternatively, muscles may possess adequate strength, but not be positioned optimally within the velopharynx following cleft palate repair or may be forced to move velopharyngeal structures that are stiffer as a result of surgical scarring.');

Substantial baseline covariate information is routinely collected in such trials, and one goal of adjustment is to exploit covariates associated with outcome to increase precision of estimation of the treatment effect. However, concerns are routinely raised over the potential for bias when the covariates used are selected post hoc and the potential for adjustment based on a model of the relationship between outcome, covariates, and treatment to invite a ''fishing expedition'' for that leading to the most dramatic effect estimate. By appealing to the theory of semiparametrics, we are led naturally to a characterization of all treatment effect estimators and to principled, practically feasible methods for covariate adjustment that yield the desired gains in efficiency and that allow covariate relationships to be identified and exploited while circumventing the usual concerns. The methods and strategies for their implementation in practice are presented.

The approach is relevant when the analyst is willing to assume that distributions governing model components that are ordinarily left unspecified in popular semiparametric regression models, such as the baseline hazard function in the proportional hazards model, have densities satisfying mild "smoothness" conditions. Densities are approximated by a truncated series expansion that, for fixed degree of truncation, results in a "parametric" representation, which makes likelihood-based inference coupled with adaptive choice of the degree of truncation, and hence flexibility of the model, computationally and conceptually straightforward with data subject to any pattern of censoring. The formulation allows popular models, such as the proportional hazards, proportional odds, and accelerated failure time models, to be placed in a common framework; provides a principled basis for choosing among them; and renders useful extensions of the models straightforward. The utility and performance of the methods are demonstrated via simulations and by application to data from time-to-event studies.');

Twenty-three additional polyps (12 adenomas and 11 hyperplastic polyps) were found on the second exams, yielding an adenoma miss rate of 55%. Fifteen polyps (5 adenomas and 10 hyperplastic polyps) were found in subjects who had chromoendoscopy and 8 polyps (7 adenomas and 1 hyperplastic polyp) in those who had intensive inspection. Chromoendoscopy was associated with more normal tissue biopsies (11 versus 5) and longer procedure times compared with intensive inspection (29.8 +/- 9.5 versus 25.3 +/- 5.8 minutes; P = 0.04). Controlling for age, number of previous colonoscopies, procedure time, and prior colonic resection, chromoendoscopy detected more polyps (P = 0.04), but adenoma detection was not significantly different compared with intensive inspection (P = 0.27).Small adenomas are frequently missed in patients with Lynch syndrome.

We found that in vitro AZD7762 alone or in combination with gemcitabine significantly sensitized MiaPaCa-2 cells to radiation. AZD7762 inhibited Chk1 autophosphorylation (S296 Chk1), stabilized Cdc25A, and increased ATR/ATM-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation (S345 Chk1). Radiosensitization by AZD7762 was associated with abrogation of the G(2) checkpoint as well as with inhibition of Rad51 focus formation, inhibition of homologous recombination repair, and persistent gamma-H2AX expression.

Expression levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting; Apaf-1 function was determined by assessing the ability of endogenous Apaf-1 to cleave caspase-9 in the presence or absence of cytochrome c. The effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A on Apaf-1 expression and function was evaluated.The authors report here that the resistance of ovarian cancer cells to the proapoptotic effects of chemotherapy is due in part to deficient Apaf-1 activity. Although Apaf-1 is expressed in most ovarian cancers, the functional activity is impaired, as Apaf-1 has a diminished ability to recruit and activate caspase-9. Treatment of ovarian cancer cells with trichostatin A results in restoration of Apaf-1 function independent of alterations in Apaf-1 expression. Furthermore, treating chemoresistant cells with sublethal doses of trichostatin A restores Apaf-1 function and sensitizes cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.Targeting intrinsic pathway defects for therapeutic intervention may result in sensitizing tumors to standard chemotherapy or triggering apoptosis in the absence of other apoptotic signals.

Using the standard morphologic criteria, we semi-quantitatively assessed a total of 24 cytomorphologic features in 123 aspirates and recorded an overall interpretation on completion of the review. Cyto-histologic correlation was evaluated and logistic regression model was performed to identify cytomorphologic features predictive of neoplasia.

The effects of age and sex were examined by a design that included 63 subjects organized into four groups: young (20-30 yr) men and women, and older (65-80 yr) men and women. In each group, one-half of the subjects underwent a traditional PRT protocol that involved shortening contractions at low velocities against high loads, while the other half performed a modified PRT protocol that involved contractions at 3.5 times higher velocity against reduced loads. Muscles were sampled by needle biopsy before and after the 14-wk PRT program, and functional tests were performed on permeabilized individual fiber segments isolated from the biopsies. We tested the hypothesis that, compared with low-velocity PRT, high-velocity PRT results in a greater increase in the cross-sectional area, force, and power of type 2 fibers. Both types of PRT increased the cross-sectional area, force, and power of type 2 fibers by 8-12%, independent of the sex or age of the subject. Contrary to our hypothesis, the velocity at which the PRT was performed did not affect the fiber-level outcomes substantially. We conclude that, compared with low-velocity PRT, resistance training performed at velocities up to 3.5 times higher against reduced loads is equally effective for eliciting an adaptive response in type 2 fibers from human skeletal muscle.');

When, however, is a reaction so fast that it represents a false start? Currently, a false start is awarded if an athlete increases the force on their starting block above a given threshold before 100 ms has elapsed after the starting gun. To test the hypothesis that the fastest valid reaction times of sprinters really is 100 ms and that no sex difference exists in that time, we analyzed the fastest reaction times achieved by each of the 425 male and female sprinters who competed at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After power transformation of the skewed data, a fixed effects ANOVA was used to analyze the effects of sex, race, round and lane position. The lower bounds of the 95, 99 and 99.9% confidence intervals were then calculated and back transformed. The mean fastest reaction time recorded by men was significantly faster than women (p<0.001). At the 99.9% confidence level, neither men nor women can react in 100 ms, but they can react in as little as 109 ms and 121 ms, respectively. However, that sex difference in reaction time is likely an artifact caused by using the same force threshold in women as men, and it permits a woman to false start by up to 21 ms without penalty. We estimate that female sprinters would have similar reaction times to male sprinters if the force threshold used at Beijing was lowered by 22% in order to account for their lesser muscle strength.');

MLN4924 inhibits NAE (NEDD8 Activating Enzyme), a pivotal regulator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF (SKP1, Cullins, and F-box protein), that has been implicated recently in DNA damage and repair. In this study, we provide evidence that MLN4924 can be used as an effective radiosensitizer in pancreatic cancer. Specifically, MLN4924 (20-100 nmol/L) effectively inhibited cullin neddylation and sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to ionizing radiation in vitro with a sensitivity enhancement ratio of approximately 1.5. Mechanistically, MLN4924 treatment stimulated an accumulation of several SCF substrates, including CDT1, WEE1, and NOXA, in parallel with an enhancement of radiation-induced DNA damage, aneuploidy, G(2)/M phase cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CDT1 and WEE1 partially abrogated MLN4924-induced aneuploidy, G(2)/M arrest, and radiosensitization, indicating a causal effect. Furthermore, MLN4924 was an effective radiosensitizer in a mouse xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer. Our findings offer proof-of-concept for use of MLN4924 as a novel class of radiosensitizer for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.');

Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of HRR (mediated by Chk1 via AZD7762) and PARP1 [via olaparib (AZD2281)] would selectively sensitize p53 mutant pancreatic cancer cells to radiation. We also used 2 isogenic p53 cell models to assess the role of p53 status in cancer cells and intestinal epithelial cells to assess overall cancer specificity. DNA damage response and repair were assessed by flow cytometry, Î³H2AX, and an HRR reporter assay. We found that the combination of AZD7762 and olaparib produced significant radiosensitization in p53 mutant pancreatic cancer cells and in all of the isogenic cancer cell lines. The magnitude of radiosensitization by AZD7762 and olaparib was greater in p53 mutant cells compared with p53 wild type cells. Importantly, normal intestinal epithelial cells were not radiosensitized. The combination of AZD7762 and olaparib caused G 2 checkpoint abrogation, inhibition of HRR, and persistent DNA damage responses. These findings demonstrate that the combination of Chk1 and PARP1 inhibition selectively radiosensitizes p53 mutant pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, these studies suggest that inhibition of HRR by Chk1 inhibitors may be a useful strategy for selectively inducing a BRCA1/2 ''deficient-like'' phenotype in p53 mutant tumor cells, while sparing normal tissue.');

A dual-task paradigm was used in which 10 community-dwelling older adults were asked to perform standing trials in the presence of a secondary task (verbal or push-button), vibrotactile feedback, or both (dual-task). Results show that subjects significantly increased the percentage of time inside the dead zone when feedback was provided compared to when it was not during both verbal (+13.6%) and push-button (+10.1%) secondary tasks. Providing feedback also decreased RMS of trunk tilt during both secondary tasks (verbal: -0.129Â°; push-button: -0.138Â°). However, response times for secondary tasks increased (verbal: +119 ms; push-button: +110 ms) when feedback was provided.

As an experimental model for the analysis of adult polygenic traits, we measured a mouse population for multiple phenotypes and conducted a genome-wide search for effector loci. Complex adult phenotypes, related to body size and bone structure, were measured as component phenotypes, and each subphenotype was associated with a genomic spectrum of candidate effector loci. The strategy successfully detected several loci for the phenotypes, at genome-wide significance, using a single, modest-sized population (N = 505). The effector loci each explain 2%-10% of the measured trait variation and, taken together, the loci can account for over 25% of a trait''s total population variation. A replicate population (N = 378) was used to confirm initially observed loci for one trait (femur length), and, when the two groups were merged, the combined population demonstrated increased power to detect loci. In contrast to human population studies, our mouse genome-wide searches find loci that individually explain a larger fraction of the observed variation. Also, the additive effects of our detected mouse loci more closely match the predicted genetic component of variation.

We found that marker-positive cells were significantly reduced by the combination of gemcitabine and AZD7762. In addition, secondary tumor initiation was significantly delayed in response to primary tumor treatment with gemcitabine + AZD7762 compared with control, gemcitabine, or AZD7762 alone. Furthermore, for the same number of stem cells implanted from gemcitabine- versus gemcitabine + AZD7762-treated primary tumors, secondary tumor initiation at 10 weeks was 83% versus 43%, respectively. We also found that pS345 Chk1, which is a measure of DNA damage, was induced in marker-positive cells but not in the marker-negative cells. These data demonstrate that Chk1 inhibition in combination with gemcitabine reduces both the percentage and the tumor-initiating capacity of pancreatic cancer stem cells.

Although the PERL trial targets T1D individuals at highest risk of kidney function decline, the use of allopurinol as a renoprotective agent may also be relevant to a larger segment of the population with diabetes. As allopurinol is inexpensive and safe, it could be cost-effective even for relatively low-risk patients, pending the completion of appropriate trials at earlier stages.');

Likewise, LB100 produced similar radiosensitization in pancreatic cancer cells, but minimal radiosensitization in normal small intestinal cells. Mechanistically, PPP2R1A siRNA or LB100 caused aberrant CDK1 activation, likely resulting from accumulation of the active forms of PLK1 (pPLK1 T210) and CDC25C (pCDC25C T130). Furthermore, LB100 inhibited radiation-induced Rad51 focus formation and homologous recombination repair (HRR), ultimately leading to persistent radiation-induced DNA damage, as reflected by Î³-H2AX expression. Finally, we identified CDC25C as a key PP2A substrate involved in LB100-mediated radiosensitization as depletion of CDC25C partially reversed LB100-mediated radiosensitization. In a mouse xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer, LB100 produced significant radiosensitization with minimal weight loss.Collectively, our data show that PP2A inhibition radiosensitizes pancreatic cancer both in vitro and in vivo via activation of CDC25C/CDK1 and inhibition of HRR, and provide proof-of-concept evidence that PP2A is a promising target for the improvement of local therapy in pancreatic cancer.');

RBX1 and SAG are both overexpressed in human lung cancer; however, their contribution to patient survival and lung tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we report that overexpression of SAG, but not RBX1, correlates with poor patient prognosis and more advanced disease. We found that SAG is overexpressed in murine KrasG12D-driven lung tumors and that Sag deletion suppressed lung tumorigenesis and extended murine life span. Using cultured lung cancer cells, we showed that SAG knockdown suppressed growth and survival, inactivated both NF-ÎºB and mTOR pathways, and resulted in accumulation of tumor suppressor substrates, including p21, p27, NOXA, and BIM. Importantly, growth suppression by SAG knockdown was partially rescued by simultaneous knockdown of p21 or the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. Treatment with MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of CRL E3s, also inhibited the formation of KrasG12D-induced lung tumors through a similar mechanism involving inactivation of NF-ÎºB and mTOR and accumulation of tumor suppressor substrates.

Although association studies utilizing the new sequencing technologies hold great promise to unravel novel genetic variants, especially rare genetic variants that contribute to human diseases, the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data remains a challenge. Advanced analytical methods are in great need to facilitate high-dimensional sequencing data analyses. In this article, we propose a generalized genetic random field (GGRF) method for association analyses of sequencing data. Like other similarity-based methods (e.g., SIMreg and SKAT), the new method has the advantages of avoiding the need to specify thresholds for rare variants and allowing for testing multiple variants acting in different directions and magnitude of effects. The method is built on the generalized estimating equation framework and thus accommodates a variety of disease phenotypes (e.g., quantitative and binary phenotypes). Moreover, it has a nice asymptotic property, and can be applied to small-scale sequencing data without need for small-sample adjustment. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GGRF attains an improved or comparable power over a commonly used method, SKAT, under various disease scenarios, especially when rare variants play a significant role in disease etiology. We further illustrate GGRF with an application to a real dataset from the Dallas Heart Study. By using GGRF, we were able to detect the association of two candidate genes, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, with serum triglyceride.');

IL-22 acted on cancer cells to promote activation of the transcription factor STAT3 and expression of the histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methytransferase DOT1L. The DOT1L complex induced the core stem cell genes NANOG, SOX2, and Pou5F1, resulting in increased cancer stemness and tumorigenic potential. Furthermore, high DOT1L expression and H3K79me2 in colorectal cancer tissues was a predictor of poor patient survival.

In this paper, we describe the dynamics of linkage disequilibrium in populations which have not undergone a demographic expansion. In these populations, it is shown that genetic drift creates disequilibrium over time, while in expanded populations, the disequilibrium decays with time. We propose that common disease alleles might be more efficiently identified by drift mapping - linkage disequilibrium mapping in small, old populations of constant size where the disequilibrium is the result of genetic drift, not founder effect.

Individual T cell subsets, as well as composite indices that combine data from two or more T cell measures at 8 or 18 months, can be combined with 3- and 9-month body weight data to provide better prediction of life span than either immune or weight measures alone.

Some of these QTL have effects that are demonstrable in young-adult mice (8 months of age) and others demonstrable only in middle-aged mice (18 months). Biomarker studies show that T-cell subset levels measured at 8 or 18 months are significant predictors of lifespan for mice dying of lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, or all causes combined. Mice whose immune systems resemble that of young animals, i.e. with low levels of CD4(+) and CD8(+) memory T cells and relatively high levels of CD4(+) T cells, tend to outlive their siblings with the opposite subset pattern. Biochemical analyses show that T cells from aged mice show defects in the activation process within a few minutes of encountering a stimulus and that the defects precede the recognition by the T-cell receptor of agonist peptides on the antigen-presenting cell.

A permutation-based test was used to detect significant associations between genetic markers and mechanical traits. This test generates p values that account for the effect of testing multiple hypotheses. Throughout the experiment, p < or = 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The total variance explained by genetic effects on each mechanical trait ranges from 2.9% to 15.4%. Most of the identified polymorphisms influence mechanical traits even after adjustment for body weight. Adjustment for femoral geometry reduces the effects of some of the QTL, but those on chromosomes 2 and 10 do not seem to be influenced by femoral geometry.Many genes and chromosomes are involved in the genetic control over mechanical integrity of cortical bone.

Cataract severity at either 18 or 24 months was also a significant predictor of life span in females only, but in contrast to what has been reported in human studies, relatively severe cataract was correlated with longer life span.

In this study, small body size at ages 2-24 months was shown to be a significant predictor of life span in a genetically heterogeneous mouse population derived from four common inbred mouse strains. The association was strongest for weights measured early in adult life, and somewhat weaker, though still statistically significant, at later ages. The effect was seen both in males and females, and was replicated in an independent population of the same genetic background. Body size at ages 2-4 months was correlated with levels of serum leptin in both males and females, and with levels of IGF-I and thyroid hormone in females only. A genome scan showed the presence of polymorphic alleles on chromosomes 2, 6, 7 and 15 with significant effects on body weight at 2-4 months, at 10-12 months, or at both age ranges, showing that weight gain trajectory in this stock is under complex genetic control. Because it provides the earliest known predictor of life span, body weight may be usefully included in screens for induced mutations that alter aging. The evidence that weight in 2-month-old mice is a significant predictor of life span suggests that at least some of the lethal diseases of old age can be timed by factors that influence growth rate in juvenile rodents.');

Genotypes from 487 mice were compared with geometric traits obtained from microCT. We found 14 genetic markers that associate with geometric traits, showing the complexity of genetic control over bone geometry.Previous studies have shown that genetic background affects bone characteristics, particularly bone mineral density, in both mouse and human populations. Much less is known, however, about the effects of polymorphic genes on bone size, shape, and mechanical integrity. In this study, we investigated the genetic determinants of geometric properties of cortical bone in mice.This study used a genetically heterogeneous mouse population, which is denoted UM-HET3 stock and is derived as the progeny of (BALB/cJ X C57BL/6J) F1 females and (C3H/HeJ X DBA/2J) F1 males. The experimental group consisted of 487 female UM-HET3 mice. Genotypic data from 99 polymorphic genetic loci was obtained from the mice at 4 weeks of age. At 18 months of age, the mice were humanely killed, and the right femurs were scanned with microcomputed tomography to assess geometric properties of cortical bone. A permutation-based test was used to detect significant associations between genetic markers and geometric traits. This test generates experiment-wise p values, which account for the effect of testing multiple hypotheses. An experiment-wise p < or = 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Fourteen genetic markers were found to significantly associate with one or more geometric traits. Two markers (D3Mit62 and D4Mit155) were associated with traits describing bone size; 2 (D12Mit167 and D14Mit170) were linked with traits describing bone shape; and 10 (D1Nds2, D5Mit95, D6Mit216, D7Mit91, D8Mit51, D9Mit110, D11Mit83, D15Mit100, D15Mit171, and D17Mit46) were associated with both size and shape.Our results indicate that the genetic control of cortical bone geometry is complex and that femoral size and shape may be influenced by different, although overlapping, groups of polymorphic loci.');

Variances of these binary diseases are presumably controlled by multiple loci and environmental variants. A least-squares method has been developed for mapping such complex disease loci by treating the binary phenotypes (0 and 1) as if they were continuous. However, the least-squares method is not recommended because of its ad hoc nature. Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods have also been developed for binary disease mapping by incorporating the discrete nature of the phenotypic distribution. In the ML analysis, the likelihood function is usually maximized using some complicated maximization algorithms (e.g. the Newton-Raphson or the simplex algorithm). Under the threshold model of binary disease, we develop an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to solve for the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). The new EM algorithm is developed by treating both the unobserved genotype and the disease liability as missing values. As a result, the EM iteration equations have the same form as the normal equation system in linear regression. The EM algorithm is further modified to take into account sexual dimorphism in the linkage maps. Applying the EM-implemented ML method to a four-way-cross mouse family, we detected two regions on the fourth chromosome that have evidence of QTLs controlling the segregation of fibrosarcoma, a form of connective tissue cancer. The two QTLs explain 50-60% of the variance in the disease liability. We also applied a Bayesian method previously developed (modified to take into account sex-specific maps) to this data set and detected one additional QTL on chromosome 13 that explains another 26% of the variance of the disease liability.

Bed rise tasks included supine to sit-to-edge, sit up in bed with hand use, and sit up in bed without hands, all performed from a bed where the HOB was adjusted to 0, 30, and 45 degrees elevations; roll to side-lying then rise (HOB 0 degrees); and supine to stand (HOB 0 degrees). Chair seat heights were adjusted according to the percent of the distance between the floor and the knee (% FK), and included rises (1) with hands and then without hands at 140, 120, 100, and 80% FK; (2) from a reclining (105 degrees at chair back) and tilting (seat tilted 10 degrees posteriorly) chair (100% FK); and (3) from a 80% FK seat height with a 4-inch cushion added, with and then without hands. Logistic regression for repeated measures was used to test for differences between tasks in the ability to rise. After log transformation of rise time, a linear effects model was used to compare rise time between tasks.The median total number of tasks successfully completed was 18 (range, 3-21). Nearly all subjects were able to rise from positions where the starting surface was elevated as long as hand use was unlimited. With the HOB at 30 or 45 degrees essentially all subjects could complete supine to sit-to-edge and sit up with hands. Essentially all subjects could rise from a seat height at 140, 120, and 100% FK as long as hand use was allowed. A small group (8-10%) of subjects was dependent upon hand use to perform the least challenging tasks, such as 140% FK without hands chair rise and 45 degrees sit up without hands. This dependency upon hand use increased significantly as the demand of the task increased, that is, as the HOB or seat height was lowered. Approximately three-quarters of the sample could not rise from a flat (0 degrees HOB elevation) bed or low (80% FK) chair when hand use was not allowed. Similar trends were seen in rise performance time, that is, performance times tended to increase as the HOB or chair seat elevation declined and as hand use was limited. Total self-reported ADL disability, compared to the single ADL transferring item, was a stronger predictor of rise ability and timed rise performance, particularly for chair rise tasks.Lowering HOB height and seat height increased bed and chair rise task difficulty, particularly when hand use was restricted. Restricting hand use in low HOB height or lowered seat height conditions may help to identify older adults with declining rise ability. Yet, many of those who could not rise under "without hands" conditions could rise under "with hands" conditions, suggesting that dependency on hand use may be a marker of progressive rise impairment but may not predict day-to-day natural milieu rise performance. Intertask differences in performance time may be statistically significant but are clinically small. Given the relationship between self-reported ADL disability and rise performance, impaired rise performance may be considered a marker for ADL disability. These bed and chair rise tasks can serve as outcomes for an intervention to improve bed and chair rise ability and might also be used in future studies to quantify improvements or declines in function over time, to refine physical therapy protocols, and to examine the effect of bed and chair design modifications on bed and chai');

The relationship between CD4 memory cell levels and life span was similarly strong regardless of the cause of death in mice whose death was attributable to lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, mammary carcinoma, and other forms of terminal pathology. Additional work is needed to discriminate between two hypotheses: 1) that high levels of CD4 memory cell themselves predispose to disease and early death, particularly from neoplasia; or 2) that accumulation of CD4 memory cells is a biomarker of some underlying process-perhaps accelerated aging-that itself leads to early mortality.');

The genes located on the inactivated X homolog are predicted to be influenced by the same underlying repression mechanism. To test the uniformity of cis-acting gene repression, 32 genetically identical F1 female mice were analyzed for differential expression of homologous alleles at three X-linked genes-Otc, Atp7a (= Mottled), and Hprt. Gene expression was assayed by the single-nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) method, thereby allowing the three genes to be quantitated from the same RNA sample. Although variable between individual animals, the relative expression of the two alleles (allelic expression ratio) of the genes is significantly correlated within each steady-state RNA pool. When examined by animal age (3 months to 12 months), no statistically significant differences were observed in the mean or variance of allelic expression ratio. Together, the results confirm that X inactivation is coordinately controlled and is stable across the early- to mid-adult life span.');

Thirteen of these people had NGT and 15 had IGT. Subjects were not taking any medication that interfered with glucose tolerance.Status of glucose tolerance was determined by an oral glucose tolerance test categorized as NGT or IGT according to WHO criteria. Insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness (SG) were assessed using a tolbutamide-assisted intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). The data were analyzed using the Minmod modeling program. Glucose tolerance (K(g)) and the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) were calculated from the IVGTT.There were no significant differences between the young-old and old-old in body mass index or in plasma glucose, insulin, or C-peptide levels in the fasting state or during the OGTT. Values for K(g), SI, SG, and AIRg from the IVGTT were similar in the two age groups. When the subjects were classified by glucose tolerance status, the subjects with NGT had age, gender, and body mass index similar to the subjects with IGT. Older people with IGT had a lower K(g) and tended to have higher fasting glucose and similar fasting insulin compared with people with NGT. IGT subjects had lower SI and tended to have lower SG. The AIRg in IGT subjects tended to be low rather than high when compared with older people with NGT.Otherwise healthy adults more than 80 years of age have measures of glucose metabolism similar to people aged 61 to 79. The presence of IGT in older adults is associated with insulin resistance, regardless of patient age.

CpG sites from four candidate genes were validated via quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing.CpG methylation varied widely among girls, and higher urinary BPA concentrations were generally associated with less genomic methylation.

In particular, hypomethylation of CpG targets on chromosome X was associated with higher urinary BPA. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, we identified a number of candidate genes in our sample that previously have been associated with BPA-related expression change.These data indicate that BPA may affect human health through specific epigenomic modification of genes in relevant pathways.

Knockdown of FLCN results in increased formation of tumors by RCC cells with wild-type VHL in orthotopic xenografts in nude mice, an indication that FLCN plays a role in the tumor-suppressing activity of VHL. Interestingly, FLCN, similarly to VHL, is necessary for the activity of LC3C-mediated autophagic program that we have previously characterized as contributing to the tumor suppressing activity of VHL.

Patterns of gene expression were correlated with morphologic and biochemical indicators of toxicity. Gene expression responses were characteristically different for each treatment. Patterns of expression were consistent with cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, diminished protein synthesis, and oxidative stress. Based upon these results, we concluded that gene expression changes provide a useful indicator of oxidative stress, as assessed by the GSH:GSSG ratio. Under the conditions of this cell culture test system, oxidative stress upregulated 5 genes, HMOX1, p21(waf1/cip1), GCLM, GR, TXNR1 while downregulating CYP1A1 and TOPO2A. Primers and probes for these genes were incorporated into the design of a 7-gene plate for RT-PCR. The plate design permitted statistical analysis and allowed clear discrimination between chemicals inducing oxidative vs nonoxidative stress. A simple oxidative stress score (0-1), based on the responses by the 7 genes (including p-value) on the RT-PCR plate, was correlated with the GSH:GSSG ratio using linear regression and ranking (Pearson product) procedures. These analyses yielded correlation coefficients of 0.74 and 0.87, respectively, for the treatments tested (when 1 outlier was excluded), indicating a good correlation between the biochemical and transcriptional measures of oxidative stress.

We have shown previously that exposure of mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells to chromate inhibits the induction of the Cyp1a1 and Nqo1 genes by dioxin. Here we have tested the hypothesis that chromium blocks gene expression by interfering with the assembly of productive transcriptional complexes at the promoter of inducible genes. To this end, we have studied the effects of chromium on the expression of genes induced by benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), another aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, and characterized the disruption of Cyp1a1 transcriptional induction by chromium. Gene expression profiling by using high density microarray analysis revealed that the inhibitory effect of chromium on B[a]P-dependent gene induction was generalized, affecting the induction of over 50 different genes involved in a variety of signaling transduction pathways. The inhibitory effect of chromium on Cyp1a1 transcription was found to depend on the presence of promoter-proximal sequences and not on the cis-acting enhancer sequences that bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator complex. By using transient reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, we found that chromium prevented the B[a]P-dependent release of HDAC-1 from Cyp1a1 chromatin and blocked p300 recruitment.

Using ANOVA, we identified 1,361 genes whose expression was higher in the nervous system than other organs and, separately, 600 genes whose expression was at least threefold higher in one or more regions of the nervous system compared with their median expression across all organs. Of the 600 genes, 381 overlapped with the 1,361-gene list.

Diverse functional categories were present in the 381 genes, including genes involved in intracellular signaling, cytoskeleton structure and function, enzymes, RNA metabolism and transcription, membrane proteins, as well as cell differentiation, death, proliferation, and division. We searched existing public sites and identified 110 known genes related to mental retardation, neurological disease, and neurodegeneration. Twenty-one of the 381 genes were within the 110-gene list, compared with a random expectation of 5.

Based on principles developed from nucleic acid renaturation kinetics studies, we show that increasing the time of hybridization from 18 h to 42 h and 66 h, especially when lower than optimal concentrations of target were used, significantly improved the quality of the microarray results. Longer hybridization times significantly increased the number of spots detected, signal-to-noise ratios, and the number of differentially expressed genes and correlations among replicate arrays. We conclude that at 18 h of incubation, target-to-probe hybridization has not reached equilibrium and that a relatively high proportion of nonspecific hybridization occurs. This result is striking, given that most, if not all, published microarray protocols stipulate 8-24 h for hybridization. Using shorter than optimal hybridization times (i.e., not allowing hybridization to reach equilibrium) has the consequence of underestimating the fold change of differentially expressed genes and of missing less represented sequences.');

Often, however, in vivo experiments are unfeasible for material or ethical reasons, and data from cultured cells must be used instead, even though it may not be known whether cultured cells and live tissues share common global responses to the same toxicant.

Aorta segments and vSMCs differed in the expression of more than 4500 genes, many showing expression differences greater than 1000-fold. Integration of microarray data into Gene Ontology Project annotations showed that many of the genes differentially expressed belonged to the same biological process or metabolic pathway. Notwithstanding these results, a subset of 35 genes responded in the same fashion to dioxin exposure in both systems. Genes in this subset encoded phase I and phase II detoxification enzymes, signal transduction kinases and phosphatases, and proteins involved in DNA repair and the cell cycle.

Paradoxically, arsenic trioxide is used successfully in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Arsenic induces oxidative stress, and its toxicity is decreased by free thiols and increased by glutathione depletion. To further characterize the role of glutathione and oxidative stress in the toxicity of arsenic, we have used fetal fibroblasts from Gclm(-/-) mice, which lack the modifier subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis. Gclm(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are eight times more sensitive to arsenite-induced apoptotic death. Because of a dramatic decrease in glutathione levels, Gclm(-/-) MEFs have a high prooxidant status that is not significantly relieved by treatment with the phenolic antioxidant tBHQ; however, tBHQ blocks arsenite-induced apoptosis in both Gclm(+/+) and Gclm(-/-) cells, although it raises a significant antioxidant response only in Gclm(+/+) cells. Global gene expression profiles indicate that tBHQ is significantly effective in reversing arsenite-induced gene deregulation in Gclm(+/+) but not in Gclm(-/-) MEFs. This effect of tBHQ is evident in the expression of metalloproteases and chaperones, and in the expression of genes involved in DNA damage and repair, protein biosynthesis, cell growth and maintenance, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. These results suggest that regulation of glutathione levels by GCLM determines the sensitivity to arsenic-induced apoptosis by setting the overall ability of the cells to mount an effective antioxidant response.');

Pulmonary inflammation and global gene expression were compared in Mt1/2(+/+) and Mt1/2(-/-) mice.

MAPPFinder analyses also noted significant decreases in genes involved in protein processing (e.g., ubiquitination, folding), which were greater in Mt1/2(-/-) mice as compared with Mt1/2(+/+) mice early in the progression of acute lung injury, possibly due to a zinc-mediated transcript destabilization. In contrast, transcript levels of genes associated with the inflammatory response, extracellular matrix regulation, and coagulation/fibrinolysis were increased more in Mt1/2(-/-) mice as compared with Mt1/2(+/+) mice late in the development of acute lung injury. Thus, MT ultimately improves survival in the progression of acute lung injury in mice. Transcriptome-wide analysis suggests that this survival may be mediated through changes in the destabilization of transcripts associated with protein processing, the subsequent augmentation of transcripts controlling inflammation, extracellular matrix regulation, coagulation/fibrinolysis, and disruption of surfactant homeostasis.');

To determine if these two estrogens exert similar actions in prostate carcinogenesis, we elevated circulating levels of estrogen in Noble (NBL) rats with E(2/DES-filled implants, while maintaining physiological levels of testosterone (T) in the animals with T-filled implants. The two estrogens induced dysplasia in a lobe-specific manner, with E2 targeting only the lateral prostate (LP) and DES impacting only the ventral prostate (VP). Gene expression profiling identified distinct and common E2-disrupted versus DES-disrupted gene networks in each lobe. More importantly, hierarchical clustering analyses revealed that T + E2 treatment primarily affected the gene expression pattern in the LP, whereas T + DES treatment primarily affected the gene expression profile in the VP. Gene ontology analyses and pathway mapping suggest that the two hormone treatments disrupt unique and/or common cellular processes, including cell development, proliferation, motility, apoptosis, and estrogen signaling, which may be linked to dysplasia development in the rat prostate. These findings suggest that the effects of xenoestrogens and natural estrogens on the rat prostate are more divergent than previously suspected and that these differences may explain the lobe-specific carcinogenic actions of the hormones.');

Oral benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) daily for 18 days in the Cyp1a1/1a2(-/-) produced the same degree of marked immunosuppression as seen in the Cyp1a1(-/-) mouse; we believe this reflects the absence of intestinal CYP1A1. Oral BaP-treated Cyp1a1/1a2/1b1(-/-) mice showed the same "rescued" response as that seen in the Cyp1a1/1b1(-/-) mouse; we believe this reflects the absence of CYP1B1 in immune tissues. Urinary metabolite profiles were dramatically different between untreated triple-knockout and wild-type; principal components analysis showed that the shifts in urinary metabolite patterns in oral BaP-treated triple-knockout and wild-type mice were also strikingly different. Liver microarray cDNA differential expression (comparing triple-knockout with wild-type) revealed at least 89 genes up- and 62 genes down-regulated (P-value < or = 0.00086). Gene Ontology "classes of genes" most perturbed in the untreated triple-knockout (compared with wild-type) include lipid, steroid, and cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism; nucleosome and chromatin assembly; carboxylic and organic acid metabolism; metal-ion binding; and ion homeostasis. In the triple-knockout compared with the wild-type mice, response to zymosan-induced peritonitis was strikingly exaggerated, which may well reflect down-regulation of Socs2 expression. If a single common molecular pathway is responsible for all of these phenotypes, we suggest that functional effects of the loss of all three Cyp1 genes could be explained by perturbations in CYP1-mediated eicosanoid production, catabolism and activities.');

Repeated acrolein exposure causes the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes, mucous cell metaplasia, and epithelial injury. Currently, the mechanisms that control these events are unclear, and the relative contribution of T-cell subsets to pulmonary pathologies following repeated exposures to irritants is unknown. To examine whether lymphocyte subpopulations regulate inflammation and epithelial cell pathology, we utilized a mouse model of pulmonary pathology induced by repeated acrolein exposures. The role of lymphocyte subsets was examined by utilizing transgenic mice genetically deficient in either alphabeta T cells or gammadelta T cells, and changes in cellular, molecular, and pathologic outcomes associated with repeated inhalation exposure to 2.0 and 0.5 ppm acrolein were measured. To examine the potential functions of lymphocyte subsets, we purified these cells from the lungs of mice repeatedly exposed to 2.0 ppm acrolein, isolated and amplified messenger RNA, and performed microarray analysis. Our data demonstrate that alphabeta T cells are required for macrophage accumulation, whereas gammadelta T cells are critical regulators of epithelial cell homeostasis, as identified by epithelial cell injury and apoptosis, following repeated acrolein exposure. This is supported by microarray analyses that indicated the T-cell subsets are unique in their gene expression profiles following acrolein exposures. Microarray analyses identified several genes that may contribute to phenotypes mediated by T-cell subpopulations including those involved in cytokine receptor signaling, chemotaxis, growth factor production, lymphocyte activation, and apoptosis. These data provide strong evidence that T-cell subpopulations in the lung are major determinants of pulmonary pathology and highlight the advantages of dissecting their effector functions in response to toxicant exposures.');

To prevent accumulation, the inducible enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) catalyzes degradation of heme. In the absence of elevated intracellular heme or oxidative stress, the basic region leucine zipper transcriptional regulator BACH1 binds HMOX1 antioxidant response elements and represses transcription. Conversely, increased intracellular heme or sulfhydryl oxidation inactivate BACH1, permitting transcriptional induction of HMOX1. Here, we investigate the effect of BACH1 inactivation on the induction of HMOX1 and as a mechanism for broader gene induction. We show that BACH1 is inactivated at low micromolar arsenite concentrations and that BACH1 inactivation is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional induction of HMOX1. Because BACH1 is thought to interact with antioxidant response element motifs, we further examined the role of BACH1 as a regulator of inducible antioxidant gene expression by assessing the global profile of gene expression following BACH1 knockdown using small interfering RNA. The loss of BACH1 function in human keratinocytes results almost exclusively in HMOX1 induction, suggesting that BACH1 may function as a rheostat regulating levels of intracellular free heme.');

We investigated changes in transcriptome by global profiling and used Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software to develop propositions about functional connections among differentially expressed genes. A neutralizing antibody was used to negate the effect of Cd-induced up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in NPrEC cells.Exposure of NPrEC to 2.5 microM Cd enhanced cell viability and accelerated cell-cycle progression. Global expression profiling identified 48 genes that exhibited >or= 1.5-fold changes in expression after 4, 8, 16, and 32 hr of Cd treatment. Pathway analyses inferred a functional connection among 35 of these genes in one major network, with TNF as the most prominent node. Fourteen of the 35 genes are related to TNF, and 11 exhibited an average of >2-fold changes in gene expression. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the up-regulation of 7 of the 11 genes (ADAM8, EDN1, IL8, IL24, IL13RA2, COX2/PTGS2, and SERPINB2) and uncovered a 28-fold transient increase in TNF expression in Cd-treated NPrEC cells.

Here, we find that the mechanism by which TGFA imparts protection includes maintenance of surfactant-associated protein B (SFTPB) transcript levels and epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent signaling in distal pulmonary epithelial cells. This protection is complex and not accompanied by a diminution in inflammatory mediator transcripts or additional stimulation of antioxidant transcripts. In mouse lung epithelial (MLE-15) cells, microarray analysis demonstrated that nickel increased transcripts of genes enriched in MTF1, E2F-1, and AP-2 transcription factor-binding sites and decreased transcripts of genes enriched in AP-1-binding sites. Nickel also increased Jun transcript and DNA-binding activity, but decreased SFTPB transcript. Expression of SFTPB under the control of a doxycycline-sensitive promoter increased survival during nickel-induced injury as compared with control mice.

Cftr-null mice lacking one or both copies of the NHE3 gene exhibited increased fluidity of their intestinal contents, which prevented the formation of obstructions and increased survival.

Microarray analysis of small intestine RNA from Cftr-null, NHE3-null, and double-null mice all revealed downregulation of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, including a cohort of genes involved in glutathione metabolism. Expression of energy metabolism genes was altered, but there were no changes in genes involved in inflammation. Total intracellular glutathione was increased in the jejunum of all of the mutants and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione was reduced in Cftr-null mutants, indicating that CFTR deficiency affects intestinal glutathione metabolism.

Surprisingly, we found that only miR-320 expression was significantly decreased in the hearts on I/R in vivo and ex vivo. This was further confirmed by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches were employed in cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes to investigate the functional roles of miR-320. Overexpression of miR-320 enhanced cardiomyocyte death and apoptosis, whereas knockdown was cytoprotective, on simulated I/R.

Using TargetScan software and proteomic analysis, we identified heat-shock protein 20 (Hsp20), a known cardioprotective protein, as an important candidate target for miR-320. This was validated experimentally by utilizing a luciferase/GFP reporter activity assay and examining the expression of Hsp20 on miR-320 overexpression and knockdown in cardiomyocytes.Our data demonstrate that miR-320 is involved in the regulation of I/R-induced cardiac injury and dysfunction via antithetical regulation of Hsp20.

Inactivation of IKKbeta by genetic or pharmacological means results in low cellular GSH content and marked reduction of redox potential. Similar to Ikkbeta(-/-) cells, Tnfr1(-/-) and p65(-/-) cells are also GSH-deficient.

Muscle transcription profiles were compared in the resting state between men (n = 6) and women (n = 8), and in response to acute RE in trained exercised vs. untrained non-exercised control muscle for each sex and time point separately (4 h post-exercise, n = 3 males, n = 4 females; 24 h post-exercise, n = 3 males, n = 4 females). A logistic regression-based method (LRpath), following Bayesian moderated t-statistic (IMBT), was used to test gene functional groups and biological pathways enriched with differentially expressed genes.This investigation identified extensive sex differences present in the muscle transcriptome at baseline and following acute RE. In the resting state, female muscle had a greater transcript abundance of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and gene transcription/translation processes. After strenuous RE at the same relative intensity, the time course of the transcriptional modulation was sex-dependent. Males experienced prolonged changes while females exhibited a rapid restoration. Most of the biological processes involved in the RE-induced transcriptional regulation were observed in both males and females, but sex specificity was suggested for several signaling pathways including activation of notch signaling and TGF-beta signaling in females. Sex differences in skeletal muscle transcriptional regulation might implicate a mechanism behind disproportional muscle growth in males as compared with female counterparts after RE training at the same relative intensity.Sex differences exist in skeletal muscle gene transcription both at rest and following acute RE, suggesting that sex is a significant modifier of the transcriptional regulation in skeletal muscle. The findings from the present study provide insight into the molecular mechanisms for sex differences in muscle phenotypes and for muscle transcriptional regulation associated with training adaptations to resistance exercise.');

With no known ligand and few known target genes, the mode of TR4 function was unclear.We report the first genome-wide identification and characterization of TR4 in vivo binding. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified TR4 binding sites in 4 different human cell types and found that the majority of target genes were shared among different cells. TR4 target genes are involved in fundamental biological processes such as RNA metabolism and protein translation. In addition, we found that a subset of TR4 target genes exerts cell-type specific functions. Analysis of the TR4 binding sites revealed that less than 30% of the peaks from any of the cell types contained the DR1 motif previously derived from in vitro studies, suggesting that TR4 may be recruited to the genome via interaction with other proteins. A bioinformatics analysis of the TR4 binding sites predicted a cis regulatory module involving TR4 and ETS transcription factors. To test this prediction, we performed ChIP-seq for the ETS factor ELK4 and found that 30% of TR4 binding sites were also bound by ELK4. Motif analysis of the sites bound by both factors revealed a lack of the DR1 element, suggesting that TR4 binding at a subset of sites is facilitated through the ETS transcription factor ELK4. Further studies will be required to investigate the functional interdependence of these two factors.Our data suggest that TR4 plays a pivotal role in fundamental biological processes across different cell types. In addition, the identification of cell type specific TR4 binding sites enables future studies of the pathways underlying TR4 action and its possible role in metabolic diseases.');

Mouse embryos from the same strain of inbred mice were transferred into a surrogate mother either of the same strain or from a different strain, allowing maternal and fetal effects on the placenta to be separated. After correction for sex and litter size, maternal strain overrode fetal strain as the key determinant of fetal weight (P < 0.0001). Computational filtering of the placental transcriptome revealed a group of 81 genes whose expression was solely dependent on the maternal strain [P < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.10]. Network analysis of this group of genes yielded highest statistical significance for pathways involved in the regulation of cell growth (such as insulin-like growth factors) as well as those involved in regulating lipid metabolism [such as the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), LDL, and HDL], both of which are known to play a role in fetal development. This novel technique may be generally applied to identify regulatory networks involved in maternal-fetal interaction and eventually help identify molecular targets in disorders of fetal growth.');

Analysis of eight paired samples revealed a profound deregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion and intracellular junctions, with changes consistent with an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, as vimentin expression was increased and E-cadherin lost in PDTC compared with adjacent PTC. Moreover, PDTC stained positively for phospho-Smad2, suggesting a role for transforming growth factor (TGF)Î² in mediating this process. Accordingly, TGFÎ²-induced EMT in primary cultures of thyroid cells from Tg-Braf mice, whereas wild-type thyroid cells retained their epithelial features. TGFÎ²-induced Smad2 phosphorylation, transcriptional activity and induction of EMT required mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation in Tg-Braf thyrocytes. Hence, tumor initiation by oncogenic BRAF renders thyroid cells susceptible to TGFÎ²-induced EMT, through a MAPK-dependent process.');

Although gene sets are defined a priori based on biological knowledge, current methods for gene set enrichment testing treat all genes equal. It is well-known that some genes, such as those responsible for housekeeping functions, appear in many pathways, whereas other genes are more specialized and play a unique role in a single pathway. Drawing inspiration from the field of information retrieval, we have developed and present here an approach to incorporate gene appearance frequency (in KEGG pathways) into two current methods, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and logistic regression-based LRpath framework, to generate more reproducible and biologically meaningful results.Two breast cancer microarray datasets were analyzed to identify gene sets differentially expressed between histological grade 1 and 3 breast cancer. The correlation of Normalized Enrichment Scores (NES) between gene sets, generated by the original GSEA and GSEA with the appearance frequency of genes incorporated (GSEA-AF), was compared. GSEA-AF resulted in higher correlation between experiments and more overlapping top gene sets. Several cancer related gene sets achieved higher NES in GSEA-AF as well. The same datasets were also analyzed by LRpath and LRpath with the appearance frequency of genes incorporated (LRpath-AF). Two well-studied lung cancer datasets were also analyzed in the same manner to demonstrate the validity of the method, and similar results were obtained.We introduce an alternative way to integrate KEGG PATHWAY information into gene set enrichment testing. The performance of GSEA and LRpath can be enhanced with the integration of appearance frequency of genes. We conclude that, generally, gene set analysis methods with the integration of information from KEGG PATHWAY performs better both statistically and biologically.');

There is limited information regarding NF-ÎºB-dependent cardioprotection, and the NF-ÎºB-dependent genes that contribute to the cardioprotection after PO are completely unknown. The objective of the study was to identify NF-ÎºB-dependent genes that contribute to cardioprotection after PO. Microarray analysis was used to delineate genes that potentially contribute to the NF-ÎºB-dependent cardioprotection by determining the overlap between the set of PO regulated genes and genes regulated by NF-ÎºB, using mice with genetic abrogation of NF-ÎºB activation in the heart. This analysis identified 16 genes as candidates for NF-ÎºB-dependent effects after PO. This set of genes overlaps with, but is significantly different from the set of genes we previously identified as regulated by NF-ÎºB after IPC. The genes encoding heat shock protein 70.3 (hspa1a) and heat shock protein 70.1 (hspa1b) were the most significantly regulated genes after PO and were up-regulated by NF-ÎºB. Results using knockout mice show that Hsp70.1 contributes to NF-ÎºB-dependent cardioprotection after PO and likely underlies, at least in part, the NF-ÎºÎ-dependent cardioprotective effect. Our previous results show that Hsp70.1 is injurious after I/R injury. This demonstrates that, like NF-ÎºB itself, Hsp70.1 has antithetical effects on myocardial survival and suggests that this may underlie the similar antithetical effects of NF-ÎºB after different ischemic stimuli. The significance of the research is that understanding the gene network regulated by NF-ÎºB after ischemic insult may lead to identification of therapeutic targets more appropriate for clinical development.');

Promoter hypermethylation is widely recognized as a mechanism in the progression of HNSCC, but the extent to which this mechanism is consistent between HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors is unknown. To investigate the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in HPV-induced and carcinogen-induced cancers, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression in HPV(+) and HPV(-) SCC cell lines. We used two platforms: the Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadArray and tiling arrays, and confirmed illustrative examples with pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR. These analyses indicate that HPV(+) cell lines have higher DNA methylation in genic and LINE-1 regions than HPV(-) cell lines. Differentially methylated loci between HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines significantly correlated with HPV-typed HNSCC primary tumor DNA methylation levels. Novel findings include higher promoter methylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes in HPV(+) cells compared to HPV(-) cells and increased expression of DNMT3A in HPV(+) cells. Additionally, CDKN2A and KRT8 were identified as interaction hubs among genes with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(-) cells. Conversely, RUNX2, IRS-1Â and CCNA1 were major hubs with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(+) cells.

Additionally, our data suggest that training blunts the transcriptional upregulation of the stress response and the downregulation of glucose metabolism, mitochondrial structure, and oxidative phosphorylation, and it enhances the transcriptional upregulation of the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton development and organization and the downregulation of gene transcription and muscle contraction.

Quantitative DNA methylation is determined at 27,578 CpG sites spanning 14,475 genes via the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray. Data are analyzed using parallel linear models adjusting for age and gender with empirical Bayes standard error methods. Gene-specific technical and functional validation is performed on an additional 13 matched pair samples, encompassing a wider age range. Analysis reveals 948 CpG sites representing 918 unique genes as potentially associated with LOAD disease status pending confirmation in additional study populations.

The CpG site with a minimum false discovery rate located in the promoter of the gene Transmembrane Protein 59 (TMEM59) is 7.3% hypomethylated in cases. Methylation at this site is functionally associated with tissue RNA and protein levels of the TMEM59 gene product. The TMEM59 gene identified from our discovery approach was recently implicated in amyloid-Î² protein precursor post-translational processing, supporting a role for epigenetic change in LOAD pathology.

Fisher meta-analysis combines evidence of association from single-disease GWA studies, assuming that each study is an independent test of the same hypothesis. The Rank Product (RP) method overcomes limitations posed by Fisher assumptions, though RP was not designed for GWA data.We modified RP to accommodate GWA data, and we call it modRP. Using p-values output from GWA studies, we aggregate evidence for association between SNPs and related phenotypes. To assess significance, RP randomly samples the observed ranks to develop the null distribution of the RP statistic, and then places the observed RPs into the null distribution. ModRP eliminates the effect of linkage disequilibrium and controls for differences in power at tested SNPs, to meet RP assumptions in application to GWA data.After validating modRP based on both positive and negative control studies, we searched for pleiotropic influences on comorbid substance use disorders in a novel study, and found two SNPs to be significantly associated with comorbid cocaine, opium, and nicotine dependence. Placing these SNPs into biological context, we developed a protein network modeling the interaction of cocaine, nicotine, and opium with these variants.ModRP is a novel approach to identifying pleiotropic genetic influences on comorbid complex diseases.

Here, we employed LRpath analysis to unravel the commonly altered pathways and other gene sets across ten cancer studies employing DNA methylation data profiled with the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. We observed a surprising level of concordance in differential methylation across multiple cancer types. For example, among commonly hypomethylated groups, we identified immune-related functions, peptidase activity, and epidermis/keratinocyte development and differentiation. Commonly hypermethylated groups included homeobox and other DNA-binding genes, nervous system and embryonic development, and voltage-gated potassium channels. For many gene sets, we observed significant overlap in the specific subset of differentially methylated genes. Interestingly, fewer DNA repair genes were differentially methylated than expected by chance.Clustering analysis performed with LRpath revealed tightly clustered concepts enriched for differential methylation.

We sought to assess what PSADT threshold is most clinically prognostic in this setting.575 patients who received SRT at a single institution for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy were retrospectively reviewed. We assessed the impact of pre-SRT PSADT on biochemical failure (BF), distant metastasis (DM), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and overall mortality (OM). Kaplan-Meier methods, hazard ratio (HR) assessment, and Cox Proportional Hazard models were used to assess the discriminatory ability of various PSADT thresholds.Sufficient data to calculate PSADTs were available for 277 patients. PSADT was prognostic for BF, DM, PCSM, and OM on univariate analysis regardless of threshold. HR assessment identified 6 months as a strong threshold. No statistically significant difference was observed in BF, DM, PCSM, or OM between patients with PSADT <3 (n=40) and 3-6 months (n=61) or between 6-10 (n=62) and >10 months (n=114). However significant differences were seen in BF (HR:2.2, [95%CI: 1.4-3.5], p<0.01) and DM (HR:2.2, [95%CI: 1.2-4.3], p=0.02) between a PSADT of 3-6 and 6-10 months. On multivariate analysis a PSADT <6 months predicted BF (HR:2.0, [95%CI: 1.4-2.9], p=0.0001), DM (HR:2.0, [95%CI: 1.2-3.4], p=0.01), and PCSM (HR:2.6, [95%CI: 1.1-5.9], p=0.02).A pre-SRT PSADT <6 months was a strong predictor of outcomes in our data set, including PCSM. The most common nomogram for SRT uses a 10-month PSADT threshold for assigning points used to assess BF following SRT.

Parotid glands in the CBCTs were aligned by deformable registration to calculate cumulative delivered doses. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured separately from each parotid gland pretherapy and periodically posttherapy.Thirty-six parotid glands of 18 patients were analyzed. Average mean planned doses was 32 Gy, and differences from planned to delivered mean gland doses were -4.9 to +8.4 Gy, median difference +2.2 Gy in glands in which delivered doses increased relative to planned. Both planned and delivered mean doses were significantly correlated with posttreatment salivary outputs at almost all posttherapy time points, without statistically significant differences in the correlations. Large dispersions (on average, SD 3.6 Gy) characterized the dose-effect relationships for both. The differences between the cumulative delivered doses and planned doses were evident at first fraction (r=.92, P<.0001) because of complex setup deviations (eg, rotations and neck articulations), uncorrected by the translational clinical alignments.After daily translational setup corrections, differences between planned and delivered doses in most glands were small relative to the SDs of the dose-saliva data, suggesting that ART is not likely to gain measurable salivary output improvement in most cases. These differences were observed at first treatment, indicating potential benefit for more complex setup corrections or adaptive interventions in the minority of patients with large deviations detected early by CBCT.');

Instead of the typical least-squares fit to a single tumor''s measured time-activity data, estimation was accomplished via a biexponential mixed model in which the curves from multiple subjects were jointly estimated. The tumor-absorbed dose estimates were determined by patient-specific Monte Carlo calculation.The mixed model gave realistic tumor time-activity fits that showed the expected uptake and clearance phases even with noisy data or missing time points. Correlation between tracer and therapy tumor-residence times (r=0.98; p<0.0001) and correlation between tracer-predicted and therapy-delivered mean tumor-absorbed doses (r=0.86; p<0.0001) were very high. The predicted and delivered absorbed doses were within Â± 25% (or within Â± 75 cGy) for 80% of tumors.The mixed-model approach is feasible for fitting tumor time-activity data in RIT treatment planning when individual least-squares fitting is not possible due to inadequate sampling points.

Before therapy and periodically for 24 months, validated patient-reported xerostomia questionnaire (XQ) scores and observer-graded xerostomia scores were recorded. Also, the stimulated and unstimulated saliva was measured selectively from each of the PGs and SMGs. The mean OC doses served as surrogates of minor salivary gland dysfunction.

Similar factors were statistically significant predictors of observer-graded xerostomia. The OC, PG, and SMG mean doses were moderately intercorrelated (r = 0.47-0.55). On multivariate analyses, after adjusting for the PG and SMG doses, the OC mean dose (p < .0001), interval from RT (p < .0001), and stimulated PG saliva (p < .0025) were significant predictors of the XQ scores and the OC mean dose and time for observer-graded xerostomia.

The effect of input artery choice on mean cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and mean transit time values in six regions of interest (one region of interest in each anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery territory) was assessed.All graphs of correlation between the anterior cerebral artery as the arterial input function and the superficial temporal artery as a surrogate arterial input function produced significant results (p < 0.0001). Excellent correlation existed between the cerebral blood flow (r = 0.96 [Pearson correlation coefficient]; rho(c) = 0.96 [concordance correlation coefficient]), cerebral blood volume (r = 0.97; rho(c) = 0.97), and mean transit time (r = 0.97; rho(c) = 0.97) values obtained with the anterior cerebral artery and the values obtained with the superficial temporal artery. Linear regression lines produced strong agreement between use of the anterior cerebral artery and use of the superficial temporal artery (cerebral blood flow, y = 1.03x + 0.65; cerebral blood volume, y = 1.05x - 0.09; mean transit time, y = 0.92x + 0.21).The preliminary results show that using an extracranial vessel such as the superficial temporal artery as a surrogate input artery can generate perfusion maps comparable with those generated with an intracranial vessel such as the anterior cerebral artery. This knowledge can be useful if the proximal intracranial vessels typically used for arterial input are not visible owing to diffuse disease, such as diffuse vasospasm and atherosclerosis, or are not included in the field of view of perfusion CT.');

Treatment was delivered until 1996 with conformal three-dimensional techniques and thereafter with multisegmental static IMRT. Of the 133 patients, 80 had oropharyngeal, 27 oral cavity, 12 hypopharyngeal, 11 laryngeal, and 3 unknown primary cancer. The AJCC stage was I in 1, II in 6, III in 26, IVA in 83, and IVB in 12; cancer was recurrent in 5. Sixty patients received primary and 73 postoperative IMRT. 86% of patients (n = 115) had ipsilateral neck metastasis. In all patients, the contralateral neck was clinically node negative but was judged to be at high risk of subclinical disease. Delineation of the superior-most extent of the nodal targets was consistent and corresponded with Rouviere''s observations. In the contralateral clinically node-negative neck, the uppermost Level II nodal target was the subdigastric (SD) nodes. To ensure coverage, the uppermost clinical target volume was delineated at the axial CT image in which the posterior belly of the digastric muscle crossed the jugular vein. In the ipsilateral neck, which was node positive in most patients, the uppermost Level II clinical target volume was delineated through the base of the skull. The uppermost retropharyngeal (RP) nodal target was delineated at the level of the top of the C1 vertebral body, accommodating Rouviere''s description of the location of the lateral RP nodes. The dose prescription was 70 Gy for the primary planning target volumes (PTVs); 64 Gy and 60 Gy for PTV of the postoperative beds with and without extracapsular extension, respectively; and 50-54 Gy for PTVs of nonoperated subclinical disease, at 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions. In-field or marginal recurrences were defined as those occurring when >95% or 20-95% of the recurrence volume, respectively, had received >95% of the prescribed dose.At a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 6-107 months), 21 patients (16%) had locoregional recurrence. Seventeen recurrences were in-field and four were marginal. The most prevalent nodal recurrence was in Level II bilaterally, where all failures were in-field. In-field failures were observed in the ipsilateral high neck cranial to the SD nodes (all in initially node-positive neck). No recurrences occurred in the contralateral high neck, cranial to the SD nodes, which was not included in the targets. The 95% confidence interval for the risk of recurrence in that region was 0-2.7%. Three RP nodal failures were observed; two were marginal, occurring ipsilateral and contralateral to the primary tumors, and centered cranial to the top of C1. After these recurrences, the RP nodal clinical target volumes were delineated bilaterally through the base of skull, without subsequent RP recurrence. These target delineation guidelines allowed the achievement of a mean contralateral parotid dose of < or =26 Gy (found previously to preserve salivary output significantly) in 82% of the patients. The 3-year actuarial LR recurrence-free survival rate of primary and postoperative IMRT patients was similar (81% and 84%, respectively). Oropharyngeal cancer patients had the greatest LR recurrence-free survival rate (94%, p <0.001). No statistically significant differences were found in the dose delivered to the PTVs or the in-field recurrence volume between patients who had or did not have LR failure.These results suggest that when the contralateral node-negative side of the neck has a high risk of subclinical metastasis, it is adequate to include the SD nodes as the cranial-most Level II nodal target in non-nasopharyngeal head-and-neck cancer. In the node-positive side of the neck, this nodal level should be delineated more cranially. The RP nodal targets should be delineated more cranially. The RP nodal targets should be delineated bilaterally and should extend to the base of the skull, rather than to the top of C1. These guidelines allowed substantial sparing of the contralateral parotid gland. The results of this series validate a consensus for target delineation adopted recently by cooperative radiotherapy groups.');

All patients had bulky disease (> or =5 cm) and/or an inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy. The IFRT dose was escalated to a maximum of 36 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity (life-threatening/fatal toxicity occurring within 28 days of ASCT). The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carmustine.The delivered dose of IFRT was 20 Gy in 9 patients, 28-30 Gy in 20, and 32-36 Gy in 2 patients to mediastinal (n = 19) and nonmediastinal (n = 12) sites. The median interval between IFRT completion and ASCT was 19 days. One patient developed Bearman Grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No other Grade 3 or 4 Bearman toxicity was observed.

Radiotherapy was delivered to the chest wall and regional nodes to a total of 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions. Treatment toxicity was assessed and a comparison of treatment outcome was performed between study patients and historical groups treated with either radiotherapy alone or excision followed by radiotherapy. The dose-limiting toxicities of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred at the second planned dose of 450 mg/m(2)/week after accrual of only six patients, resulting in a MTD of 300 mg/m(2)/week. Myelosuppression and skin desquamation were commonly observed. Actuarial rates of local-regional control were 100%, 50%, and 90% at 2 years for the gemcitabine with radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, and excision followed by radiotherapy groups, respectively (p = 0.105). The difference among the Kaplan-Meier curves for overall local-regional control was statistically significant at p = 0.007 in favor of combined gemcitabine and radiotherapy. The MTD of gemcitabine is 300 mg/m(2)/week when gemcitabine is delivered concurrently with radiotherapy for unresectable chest wall failures.

Cardiac chambers (left and right atria [LA/RA] and left and right ventricles [LV/RV]) and coronary vessels (left main [LM], left anterior descending [LAD], left circumflex [LCX], right coronary [RCA] and posterior descending [PDA] arteries) were contoured on contrast-enhanced CT scans and verified by a cardiologist (T.K.). Five PMRT techniques were applied to each case; 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions was delivered to the chest wall +/- internal mammary node targets. The techniques were: (1) standard tangents (TAN); (2) cobalt (Co); (3) reverse hockey stick (RHS); (4) mixed photon/electron beam (20/80); and (5) partially wide tangent fields (PWTF). Three-dimensional dose calculations for 100 plans were performed for all structures. Plans were compared by using the mean dose (Dmean) and the volume that received more than 30 Gy (V(30)) and 45 Gy (V(45)) for each structure.Cobalt and 20/80 techniques delivered higher Dmeans to the whole heart and individual cardiac chambers (RA, RV, LA, and LV) as compared with the other three techniques. The heart received a Dmean of 21.03 +/- 3.5 Gy from Co and 11.87 +/- 5.22 Gy from 20/80. The remaining techniques delivered heart Dmeans of 2.90-4.94 Gy. When V(30) was used as a metric, all techniques had comparably low V(30) to the heart, except for Co, which resulted in a significantly higher irradiated volume of right-sided cardiac chambers (59.06% +/- 30.7 for RA F-test < 0.0001; and 61.46% +/- 22.13 for RV, F-test < 0.0001). Dmean to the proximal LAD (LAD_p) was significantly higher for RHS (17.64 +/- 7.43 Gy) and 20/80 (20.52 +/- 8.36 Gy) and lowest for PWTF (9.5 +/- 4.16 Gy). The Dmean for the distal LAD (LAD_d) was significantly lower with PWTF (11.02 +/- 7.34 Gy) than with all other techniques, including TAN (p < 0.0001). Similar results for PWTF and TAN were observed when V30 and V45 were used.Cardiac substructures receive the most radiation exposure after PMRT with CO, 20/80 or both and least exposure with PWTF. Although TAN resulted in significant sparing of the majority of the cardiac structures, a significantly higher dose and volume of LAD was exposed when compared with PWTF. Although the clinical relevance of these dose differences is not clearly understood, these dosimetric estimates can serve as a baseline in the development of new techniques for locoregional treatment that will further reduce cardiac exposure.');

Reduction in the likelihood of local recurrence associated with RT did not result in higher utilities. Utilities for noninvasive recurrence were only lower after initial treatment with RT. Patient and nonpatient participants had the lowest utilities for invasive local recurrence, regardless of initial treatment or manner of salvage therapy. When comparing patient and nonpatient utilities directly, patients had higher utility for being without recurrence after initial RT and lower utility for invasive recurrence salvaged by mastectomy after initial BCS alone.

Body weights and metabolic evaluations were obtained before and during induction chemotherapy and chemo-RT. Greatest percent changes in weight and in the laboratory values were calculated for each phase of therapy.During induction chemotherapy, significant changes were found in BUN, BUN:creatinine ratio, HCO3, Mg, and albumin, but not in creatinine, Na, K, or weight. During chemo-RT, significant additional changes were observed in all parameters measured, including increases in BUN, creatinine, BUN: creatinine ratio, and HCO3 and decreases in Mg, albumin, Na, K, and weight. The magnitude of most of these changes was significantly greater during chemo-RT than during induction chemotherapy. During chemo-RT, 35% of the patients had more than 10% body weight loss and 6 patients had an increase in creatinine of more than 100%, including 5 patients with Grade 2 nephrotoxicity, all of whom had weight loss 10% or more.

We sought to determine the rates of appearance or increase in manifestations of GO in American patients treated with radioiodine for hyperthyroidism.The study population, which consisted of 76 patients (range, 10.6-72 y), included 61 women and individuals of diverse ethnicity. The patients were followed for 1 y after radioiodine treatment. The clinical activity score (CAS) included 10 items of ophthalmic change that were evaluated at 2 and 6 mo and at 1 y; appearance of a new item scored 1 point. We evaluated interactions of 6 covariates-prolonged hyperthyroidism, prolonged hypothyroidism, smoking, treatment with an antithyroid drug (ATD), and serum levels of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and of high free T3 (FT3)--with the numbers of patients with 2 or more CAS points and with exophthalmometer readings increased by at least 2 mm. In addition, patients completed a scored quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaire at baseline and at 1 y to assess eye symptoms.The mean CAS points for all patients at 2 mo was 0.63 and was not significantly different at 1 y. In 9 of 10 CAS items, there were few patients affected at 1 y and for the most part there were fewer patients affected than at baseline. However, exophthalmometer readings increased in 39% of patients by a mean of 2.6 mm. Individual patients frequently exhibited increases and decreases in item manifestations. Exophthalmometer readings decreased by 2 mm or less in 13%. Of the covariates, only hyperthyroidism prolonged by at least 2.5 mo was significantly associated with 2 or more CAS points at 1 y; no covariate was significantly associated with the development of increased exophthalmometer readings. Eye symptoms recorded in the QOL were insignificantly improved over the year; symptoms did not correlate with CAS points or with exophthalmometer readings.After radioiodine treatment, no substantial change was seen in manifestations of CAS items except for a modest increase in exophthalmometer readings in 39% of patients. Manifestations of CAS items frequently appeared and disappeared. Prolonged hyperthyroidism is best avoided. Ocular symptoms were insignificantly fewer at 1 y after radioiodine therapy.

This model was used along with refill curve information to measure absolute perfusion within renal cortex for a 100-cm(3) volume. Perfusion measurements from a slice within the volume were also made using a modified interval imaging technique. The measured perfusion using the dual-beam technique was consistent with the perfusion measured using the interval imaging technique (dual-beam values were 1.06 +/- 0.04 x corresponding interval imaging values).

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2585,19673210,'Calcium concentration may be a useful feature for distinguishing benign from malignant lung nodules in computer-aided diagnosis. The calcium concentration can be estimated from the measured CT number of the nodule and a CT number vs calcium concentration calibration line that is derived from CT scans of two or more calcium reference standards. To account for CT number nonuniformity in the reconstruction field, such calibration lines may be obtained at multiple locations within lung regions in an anthropomorphic phantom. The authors performed a study to investigate the effects of patient body size, anatomic region, and calibration nodule size on the derived calibration lines at ten lung region positions using both single energy (SE) and dual energy (DE) CT techniques. Simulated spherical lung nodules of two concentrations (50 and 100 mg/cc CaCO3) were employed. Nodules of three different diameters (4.8, 9.5, and 16 mm) were scanned in a simulated thorax section representing the middle of the chest with large lung regions. The 4.8 and 9.5 mm nodules were also scanned in a section representing the upper chest with smaller lung regions. Fat rings were added to the peripheries of the phantoms to simulate larger patients. Scans were acquired on a GE-VCT scanner at 80, 120, and 140 kVp and were repeated three times for each condition. The average absolute CT number separations between the calibration lines were computed. In addition, under- or overestimates were determined when the calibration lines for one condition (e.g., small patient) were used to estimate the CaCO3 concentrations of nodules for a different condition (e.g., large patient). The authors demonstrated that, in general, DE is a more accurate method for estimating the calcium contents of lung nodules. The DE calibration lines within the lung field were less affected by patient body size, calibration nodule size, and nodule position than the SE calibration lines. Under- or overestimates in CaCO3 concentrations of nodules were also in general smaller in quantity with DE than with SE. However, because the slopes of the calibration lines for DE were about one-half the slopes for SE, the relative improvement in the concentration estimates for DE as compared to SE was about one-half the relative improvement in the separation between the calibration lines. Results in the middle of the chest thorax section with large lungs were nearly completely consistent with the above generalization. On the other hand, results in the upper-chest thorax section with smaller lungs and greater amounts of muscle and bone were mixed. A repeat of the entire study in the upper thorax section yielded similar mixed results. Most of the inconsistencies occurred for the 4.8 mm nodules and may be attributed to errors caused by beam hardening, volume averaging, and insufficient sampling. Targeted, higher resolution reconstructions of the smaller nodules, application of high atomic number filters to the high energy x-ray beam for improved spectral separation, and other future developments in DECT may alleviate these problems and further substantiate the superior accuracy of DECT in quantifying the calcium concentrations of lung nodules.');

Mixed-effects meta-regression was incorporated to assess the relationship between RE dosage and changes in LBM.data from 49 studies, representing a total of 1328 participants, were pooled using random-effect models. Results demonstrated a positive effect for LBM, and there was no evidence of publication bias. The Cochran Q statistic for heterogeneity was 497.8, which was significant (P < 0.01). Likewise, I was equal to 84%, representing rejection of the null hypothesis of homogeneity. The weighted pooled estimate of mean LBM change was 1.1 kg (95% confidence interval = 0.9-1.2 kg). Meta-regression revealed that higher-volume interventions were associated (Î² = 0.05, P < 0.01) with significantly greater increases in LBM, whereas older individuals experienced less increase (Î² = -0.03, P = 0.01).RE is effective for eliciting gains in LBM among aging adults, particularly with higher-volume programs.

Statistical analysis identified: 1) demographic characteristics; 2) differences between the two universities; 3) how video game play differs across gender, age, degree program and familiarity with computers; and 4) characteristics of students who play most frequently.217 medical students participated. About half were female (53%). Respondents liked the idea of using technology to enhance healthcare education (98%), felt that education should make better use of new media technologies (96%), and believed that video games can have educational value (80%). A majority (77%) would use a multiplayer online healthcare simulation on their own time, provided that it helped them to accomplish an important goal.

In contrast, Internet-based behavior change interventions can be disseminated widely at a lower cost. However, the impact of some Internet-mediated programs is limited by high attrition rates. Online communities that allow participants to communicate with each other by posting and reading messages may decrease participant attrition.Our objective was to measure the impact of adding online community features to an Internet-mediated walking program on participant attrition and average daily step counts.This randomized controlled trial included sedentary, ambulatory adults who used email regularly and had at least 1 of the following: overweight (body mass index [BMI] â¥ 25), type 2 diabetes, or coronary artery disease. All participants (n = 324) wore enhanced pedometers throughout the 16-week intervention and uploaded step-count data to the study server. Participants could log in to the study website to view graphs of their walking progress, individually-tailored motivational messages, and weekly calculated goals. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 versions of a Web-based walking program. Those randomized to the "online community" arm could post and read messages with other participants while those randomized to the "no online community" arm could not read or post messages. The main outcome measures were participant attrition and average daily step counts over 16 weeks. Multiple regression analyses assessed the effect of the online community access controlling for age, sex, disease status, BMI, and baseline step counts.Both arms significantly increased their average daily steps between baseline and the end of the intervention period, but there were no significant differences in increase in step counts between arms using either intention-to-treat or completers analysis. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the average step count increase across both arms was 1888 Â± 2400 steps. The percentage of completers was 13% higher in the online community arm than the no online community arm (online community arm, 79%, no online community arm, 66%, P = .02). In addition, online community arm participants remained engaged in the program longer than no online community arm participants (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.25 - 0.90, P = .02). Participants with lower baseline social support posted more messages to the online community (P < .001) and viewed more posts (P < .001) than participants with higher baseline social support.Adding online community features to an Internet-mediated walking program did not increase average daily step counts but did reduce participant attrition.

Computerized self-management programs are effective clinical tools to support patient participation in physical activity. This pilot study sought to develop and evaluate an online interface for primary care providers to refer patients to an Internet-mediated walking program called Stepping Up to Health (SUH) and to monitor participant progress in the program.In Phase I of the study, we recruited six pairs of physicians and medical assistants from two family practice clinics to assist with the design of a clinical interface. During Phase II, providers used the developed interface to refer patients to a six-week pilot intervention. Provider perspectives were assessed regarding the feasibility of integrating the program into routine care. Assessment tools included quantitative and qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews, surveys, and online usage logs.In Phase I, 13 providers used SUH and participated in two interviews. Providers emphasized the need for alerts flagging patients who were not doing well and the ability to review participant progress. Additionally, providers asked for summary views of data across all enrolled clinic patients as well as advertising materials for intervention recruitment. In response to this input, an interface was developed containing three pages: 1) a recruitment page, 2) a summary page, and 3) a detailed patient page. In Phase II, providers used the interface to refer 139 patients to SUH and 37 (27%) enrolled in the intervention. Providers rarely used the interface to monitor enrolled patients. Barriers to regular use of the intervention included lack of integration with the medical record system, competing priorities, patient disinterest, and physician unease with exercise referrals. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that patients increased walking by an average of 1493 steps/day from pre- to post-intervention (t = (36) = 4.13, p < 0.01).Providers successfully referred patients using the SUH provider interface, but were less willing to monitor patient compliance in the program. Patients who completed the program significantly increased their step counts.

All laboratory data were based upon the initial cross-section of patients in DOPPS I and II. Cox regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality with adjustments for case-mix including 14 classes of comorbidity.There were no clinically significant differences in baseline characteristics between those who had measured uric acid (n = 4637) and those who did not (n = 1190). Uric acid level was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR: 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90 to 1.00 per 1 mg/dl higher uric acid level) and CV mortality (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.99).

The aims of this study were to evaluate to what extent COX- and lipoxygenase-derived products could be modulated by dietary fish oil in normal colonic mucosa and to evaluate the role of COX-1 and COX-2 in the formation of these products. Mice (wild-type, COX-1 null or COX-2 null) were fed a diet supplying a broad mixture of fatty acids present in European/American diets, supplemented with either olive oil (oleate control diet) or menhaden (fish) oil ad libitum for 9-11 weeks. Colonic eicosanoid levels were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), and proliferation was assessed by Ki67 immunohistochemistry. For the dietary alteration of colonic arachidonic acid: eicosapentaenoic ratios resulted in large shifts in formation of COX and lipoxygenase metabolites. COX-1 knockout virtually abolished PGE(2) formation, but interestingly, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (12-HETE) acid and 15-HETE formation was increased. The large changes in eicosanoid profiles were accompanied by relatively small changes in colonic crypt proliferation, but such changes in eicosanoid formation might have greater biological impact upon carcinogen challenge.

Japan had the highest (139.1 Â± 2.6 mEq/L) and Australia/New Zealand had the lowest mean serum sodium level (137.4 Â± 2.8 mEq/L). Serum sodium level was associated positively with male sex, black race, body mass index, serum albumin level, and creatinine level and negatively with neurologic and psychiatric disease, white blood cell count, and intradialytic weight loss (0.16 mEq/L lower per 1% loss). Higher serum sodium level was associated with lower adjusted all-cause mortality in a continuous model (HR, 0.95 per 1 mEq/L higher; 95% CI, 0.93-0.97). Dialysate sodium prescription was not associated with serum sodium level. Mortality analyses restricted to the serum sodium tertile with the highest mortality (serum sodium <137 mEq/L) showed lower mortality risk in patients with dialysate sodium prescriptions >140 mEq/L.Causality cannot be established in this observational study, which does not consider potential effects of dialysate sodium level on postdialysis thirst, dietary salt and water intake, interdialytic weight gain, and cardiovascular stability.Lower serum sodium levels are associated with certain hemodialysis patient characteristics and higher adjusted risk of death.

The biological effects of S-HETEs and R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (produced by distinct pathways) may differ, but levels of these compounds in the colon are unknown. The objective of this study was to develop chiral methods to characterize hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (HETE) enantiomers in colonic mucosa and evaluate the effects of fish oil on HETE formation. C57BL/6 mice (COX-1 null, COX-2 null, wild-type) were fed a diet supplemented with either olive oil or menhaden oil for 11 wk, and R-/S-HETEs in colonic mucosa were quantified by chiral LC-MS/MS.

Fish oil reduced levels of both R- and S-HETEs, and increased the preponderance of the R-enantiomers (particularly 12- and 15-HETEs).

Sixty-two colorectal polyps--37 adenomatous polyps, 23 hyperplastic polyps, and 2 sessile serrated polyps (SSP)--from 34 subjects with germline MMR gene mutations were tested for MSI using a single pentaplex PCR for five mononucleotide repeat microsatellite markers, and also for expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 proteins by immunohistochemistry. High-level MSI (MSI-H) was seen in 15 of 37 (41%) adenomatous polyps, one of 23 (4%) hyperplastic polyps, and one of two (50%) SSPs. Loss of MMR protein expression was seen in 18 of 36 (50%) adenomatous polyps, zero of 21 hyperplastic polyps, and zero of two SSPs. Adenomatous polyps 8 mm or larger in size were significantly more likely to show MSI-H [OR, 9.98; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.52-65.65; P = 0.02] and deficient MMR protein expression (OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.20-8.37; P = 0.02) compared with those less than 8 mm in size. All (six of six) adenomatous polyps 10 mm or larger in size showed both MSI-H and loss of MMR protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Our finding that the prevalence of MMR deficiency increases with the size of adenomatous polyps suggests that loss of MMR function is a late event in Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal neoplasia. Although testing large adenomatous polyps may be of value in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected Lynch syndrome, the absence of an MMR-deficient phenotype in an adenoma cannot be considered as a strong evidence against Lynch syndrome, as it is with colorectal carcinomas.');

Most respondents reported that their accommodations met their needs well, although 2 spent up to 10 hours weekly arranging accommodations. Of 25 physicians, 17 reported primary care specialties; 7 of 31 trainees planned to enter primary care specialties. Over 20% of trainees anticipated working with DHoH patients, whereas physicians on average spent 10% of their time with DHoH patients. Physicians'' accommodation satisfaction was positively associated with career satisfaction and recommending medicine as a career.DHoH physicians and trainees seemed satisfied with frequent, multimodal accommodations from employers and educators. These results may assist organizations in planning accommodation provisions. Because DHoH physicians and trainees seem interested in primary care and serving DHoH patients, recruiting and training DHoH physicians has implications for the care of this underserved population.');

Diet data were collected during the same week that fatigue was measured.Fatigue and dietary intake.Mean daily intake of whole grains, vegetables, and, in particular, green leafy vegetables and tomatoes were significantly higher in the nonfatigued group compared to fatigued cancer survivors. Also, cancer survivors reporting no fatigue had significantly higher intakes of certain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant nutrients.Increased consumption of whole grains, vegetables, and foods rich in certain anti-inflammatory nutrients was associated with decreased levels of PCRF. Additional rigorous studies are required to investigate possible mechanisms and causal relationships regarding the benefits of particular diets on PCRF.Nurses, as one of the main providers of care to cancer survivors, should continue to follow National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommendations until additional data on diet and fatigue are evaluated.Nurses should be aware of national guidelines for nutritional recommendations for treating cancer-related fatigue. In addition, nurses should ask about and record the cancer survivor''s typical dietary intake.

Overall expression and distributions of Bax, Bcl-2, p21, hTERT, and MIB-1 (Ki-67) in colorectal crypts in rectal mucosa biopsies were measured using automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis. Relative to placebo, Bax expression in the ginger group decreased 15.6% (P = 0.78) in the whole crypts, 6.6% (P = 0.95) in the upper 40% (differentiation zone) of crypts, and 21.7% (P = 0.67) in the lower 60% (proliferative zone) of crypts; however, there was a 19% increase (P = 0.14) in Bax expression in the upper 40% relative to the whole crypt. While p21 and Bcl-2 expression remained relatively unchanged, hTERT expression in the whole crypts decreased by 41.2% (P = 0.05); the estimated treatment effect on hTERT expression was larger in the upper 40% of crypts (-47.9%; P = 0.04).

The former targeted increases in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, monounsaturated, and n3 fats. The Healthy Eating diet was based on Healthy People 2010 recommendations. At baseline, dietary fat and carotenoid intakes were poorly associated (Spearman Ï < 0.4) with serum and colon concentrations. Strong associations were observed between serum and colon measurements of Î²-cryptoxanthin (Ï = 0.58; P < 0.001), Î±-carotene (Ï = 0.48; P < 0.001), and Î²-carotene (Ï = 0.45; P < 0.001). After six months, the Healthy Eating intervention increased serum lutein, Î²-, and Î±-carotene significantly (P < 0.05). In the Mediterranean arm, the significant increases were in serum lutein, Î²-cryptoxanthin, Î²-carotene, monounsaturated, and n3 fats. A significant group-by-time interaction (P = 0.03) was obtained for monounsaturated fats. Colonic increases in carotenoids and n3 fats were significant only in Healthy Eating arm, whereas the group-by-time interaction was significant for Î²-carotene (P = 0.02) and Î±-carotene (P = 0.03).

Prescription of high dialysate bicarbonate concentration (â¥38 mEq/L) was most common in the United States (45% of patients). Approximately 50% of DOPPS facilities used a single dialysate bicarbonate concentration. 3,913 patients (23%) died during follow-up. Dialysate bicarbonate concentration was associated positively with mortality (adjusted HR, 1.08 per 4 mEq/L higher [95% CI, 1.01-1.15]; HR for dialysate bicarbonate â¥38 vs 33-37 mEq/L, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.97-1.19]). Results were consistent across levels of pre-dialysis session serum bicarbonate and between facilities that used a single dialysate bicarbonate concentration and those that prescribed different concentrations to individual patients. The association of dialysis bicarbonate concentration with mortality was stronger in patients with longer dialysis vintage.Due to the observational nature of the present study, we cannot rule out that the reported associations may be biased by unmeasured confounders.High dialysate bicarbonate concentrations, especially prolonged exposure, may contribute to adverse outcomes, likely through the development of postdialysis metabolic alkalosis.

A decision aid that clarifies patient preferences and improves decision quality can aid shared decision making and be effective at increasing colorectal cancer screening rates. However, exactly how such an intervention improves shared decision making is unclear. This study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, seeks to provide detailed understanding of how an interactive decision aid that elicits patient''s risks and preferences impacts patient-clinician communication and shared decision making, and ultimately colorectal cancer screening adherence.This is a two-armed single-blinded randomized controlled trial with the target of 300 patients per arm. The setting is eleven community and three academic primary care practices in Metro Detroit. Patients are men and women aged between 50 and 75 years who are not up to date on colorectal cancer screening. ColoDATES Web (intervention arm), a decision aid that incorporates interactive personal risk assessment and preference clarification tools, is compared to a non-interactive website that matches ColoDATES Web in content but does not contain interactive tools (control arm). Primary outcomes are patient uptake of colorectal cancer screening; patient decision quality (knowledge, preference clarification, intent); clinician''s degree of shared decision making; and patient-clinician concordance in the screening test chosen. Secondary outcome incorporates a Structural Equation Modeling approach to understand the mechanism of the causal pathway and test the validity of the proposed conceptual model based on Theory of Planned Behavior. Clinicians and those performing the analysis are blinded to arms.The central hypothesis is that ColoDATES Web will improve colorectal cancer screening adherence through improvement in patient behavioral factors, shared decision making between the patient and the clinician, and concordance between the patient''s and clinician''s preferred colorectal cancer screening test. The results of this study will be among the first to examine the effect of a real-time preference assessment exercise on colorectal cancer screening and mediators, and, in doing so, will shed light on the patient-clinician communication and shared decision making ''black box'' that currently exists between the delivery of decision aids to patients and subsequent patient behavior.ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01514786.');

Unadjusted incidence rates were determined using Poisson models. Demographic and symptom-related risk factors for incidence were assessed using discrete time survival analysis.Women who screened negative for vulvodynia at baseline and were followed through at least one additional survey (n=1,786) were assessed for onset of vulvodynia. The incidence rate was 4.2 cases per 100 person-years, and rates per 100 person-years were greater in women who were younger (7.6 cases per 100 person-years at age 20 years, compared with 3.3 cases per 100 person-years at age 60 years), Hispanic (9.5 cases per 100 person-years), married, or living as married (4.9 cases per 100 person-years); had reported symptoms of vulvar pain but did not meet vulvodynia criteria on the initial survey (11.5 cases per 100 person-years); or had reported past symptoms suggesting a history of vulvodynia (7.5 cases per 100 person-years). Increased risk of new-onset vulvodynia also included baseline sleep disturbance, chronic pain in general, specific comorbid pain disorders, and specific comorbid psychological disorders.The incidence rates of vulvodynia differ by age, ethnicity, and marital status. Onset is more likely among women with previous symptoms of vulvodynia or those with intermediate symptoms not meeting criteria for vulvodynia and among those with pre-existing sleep, psychological, and comorbid pain disorders.

Heart disease was perceived to be the most controllable compared to cancers, which were perceived to be the least controllable. Women had higher perceived risk and worry ratings compared to men for several diseases.These data highlight how individuals comparatively view chronic diseases.

There were no significant changes in blood lipids, triacylglycerol, insulin, glucose, or C-reactive protein. Mean plasma carotenoids increased by 55%, which is consistent with a large increase in fruit and vegetable consumption. Likewise, changes in fat intakes were reflected in blood fatty acids, with a 25% increase in mean plasma monounsaturated fatty acids. Principal component analysis was conducted to examine the sources of interindividual variation for changes in carotenoid and fatty acid levels. Changes in the Mediterranean diet were clustered together in 4 components that accounted for 78% of the variance in plasma levels. Increases in plasma lutein, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene clustered together in a "vegetable" pattern, and increases in carotenoids found in fruit, beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin also clustered together but accounted for less of the variance. Increases in plasma monounsaturated fatty acids were clustered with a decrease in plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids, consistent with substitution in the type of oils consumed. The only association of fatty acid levels with carotenoids was that of lycopene, which clustered together with an increase in saturated fatty acids.

IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured by ELISA in plasma taken predosing and on day 29. Resveratrol was safe, but the 2.5 and 5 g doses caused mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms. Resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-4''-O-glucuronide, and resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide were major plasma metabolites. Maximal plasma levels and areas under the concentration versus time curve for the metabolites dramatically exceeded those for resveratrol, in the case of areas under the concentration versus time curve, by up to 20.3-fold. Compared with predosing values, the ingestion of resveratrol caused a decrease in circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 (P<0.04 for both), respectively, in all volunteers. The decrease was most marked at the 2.5 g dose level.

Depressed patients (n=573) from 37 practices from two primary care networks were randomized to fluoxetine, paroxetine or sertraline, and then followed naturalistically. At 1, 3, 6 and 9 months after treatment initiation, assessments were made of depressive symptom severity, social and work functioning, positive well-being, hopefulness beliefs and somatic complaints. Data were analyzed with linear regression modeling.Although 68% and 88% of total mood improvement occurred by Months 1 and 3, respectively, improvement plateaued sooner for somatic complaints (P=.001 at Month 1), and more gradually for hopefulness [P (Month 1)=.015, P (Month 3)=.036]. Although magnitude of improvement was interrelated across outcomes, timing of mood improvement was unrelated to the timing of improvement in both somatic complaints and hopefulness. Improvement in somatic complaints was primarily attributable to improvements in head, back and stomach pain.Work and social functioning, and positive affect improve synchronously with mood. Compared to mood, improvement in pain complaints peaks earlier, whereas improvement in hopefulness is much more linear over time. Because depression treatment response appears to be complex and multidimensional, a broader conceptualization of depression remission may be indicated.');

For the 2D-CSI spectroscopy, larger volumes of interest (VOIs) were centered at the level of the basal ganglia and the supraventricular white matter. Within these larger areas, 16 smaller voxels were placed in a number of regions previously implicated in pain processing. N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine(Cr), choline (Cho)/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios were calculated for each voxel.

Correlations between clinical symptoms and metabolite ratios were assessed. Cho/Cr variability in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was significantly different in the 2 groups; a significant correlation between Cho/Cr in this location and clinical pain was present in the FM group. Evoked pain threshold correlated significantly with NAA/Cho ratios in the left insula and left basal ganglia.Our data suggest that there are baseline differences in the variability of brain metabolite relative concentrations between patients with FM and HC, especially in the right DLPFC.

Following resumption of smoking for at least a week, we then tested participants on their ability to abstain for an 11-day interval. During the withdrawal test, high-depressed smokers and men exhibited elevated craving and withdrawal scores overall, whereas no differences emerged for dependence. Cue exposure produced significant increases in craving but not withdrawal. During the smoke-exposure test, men were significantly more likely than women, and high-depressed smokers more likely than low-depressed smokers, to show evidence of experiencing pleasurable "buzzes." High-dependent smokers showed significant increases in diastolic blood pressure, possibly suggestive of greater sensitivity to nicotine. During the quit test, high-dependent smokers had more difficulty abstaining than low-dependent smokers, and women more than men; no differences emerged based on depression. Independently of group membership, inability to abstain was predicted by increased anxiety, depression, and difficulty concentrating in response to cue exposure. These findings provide support for the existence of phenotypes that can be distinguished by withdrawal symptomatology (primarily driven by depression) and ability to remain abstinent (primarily driven by dependence).');

Pain intensity levels were captured in real time by participants using electronic diaries. Variability in pain was assessed as the standard deviation of pain entries over time (pain variability index [PVI]).Substantial between-subject differences in pain variability were observed (mean +/- SD PVI 1.61 +/- 0.656 [range 0.27-4.05]).

Sixty-five subjects enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of acupuncture were observed longitudinally. Clinical pain was measured on a 101-point numerical rating scale (NRS) and the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), whereas evoked pressure sensitivity was assessed via manual tender point count, dolorimetry, and MRS methods. Improvements in clinical pain and evoked pain were assessed irrespective of group assignment. Improvement was seen in clinical pain during the course of the trial as measured by both NRS (P = .032) and SF-MPQ (P = .001). The MRS was the only evoked pain measure to improve correspondingly with treatment (MRS, P = .001; tender point count and dolorimeter, P > .05). MRS change scores were correlated with changes in NRS pain ratings (P = .003); however, this association was not stronger than tender point or dolorimetry correlations with clinical pain improvement (P > .05).

Secondary endpoints included differences in depression, anxiety, fatigue, rate of adverse events, and prevalence of complications or benefits associated with Essiac during standard breast-cancer treatment. Additionally, we described the pattern of use of Essiac in this cohort of women.We performed a retrospective cohort study in 510 women, randomly chosen from the Ontario Cancer Tumour Registry, with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer in 2003.With the exception changes in a Physical well-being subscale and a relationship with doctor subscale, Essiac did not have a significant effect on HR-QOL or mood states. Even for Physical well-being and relationship with doctor, Essiac seemed to have a negative effect, with Essiac users doing worse than the non-Essiac users. This might be attributed to the fact that the group of users comprised younger women with more advanced stages of breast cancer, and both of these subgroups of patients have been shown to be at a significantly increased risk for negative mood states and/or a decreased sense of well-being. The women were taking low doses (total daily dose 43.6 +/- 30.8 mL) of Essiac that corresponded to the label directions found on most Essiac products.

The subjects in this study were participating in a randomized trial of an individualized approach towards weight loss in Detroit, MI. Breast cancer survivors (body mass index of 30-44 kg/m(2)) were enrolled and fasting blood samples were obtained for leptin analysis over 1 year of study. Leptin levels were available from at least two time points for 36 women, and weight change ranged from a gain of 11% to a loss of 25% of baseline weight. Using a repeated-measures regression model, both baseline leptin level and concurrent percent body fat were found to synergistically predict leptin levels. Thus, for women with the same body fat, those with higher baseline leptin levels are predicted to exhibit smaller decreases in leptin with weight loss. Similar results were obtained for body weight and body weight change, but the associations with body fat were stronger. Breast cancer survivors with initially higher leptin levels may differ with regard to regulation of change in leptin during weight loss resulting in relatively smaller changes in leptin with equivalent amounts of weight loss.');

The lack of consistency among the contemporary criteria systems limits the comparability of outcomes measured in epidemiological and clinical studies. The ICDAS criteria were developed by an international team of caries researchers to integrate several new criteria systems into one standard system for caries detection and assessment. Using ICDAS in the DCR-OHD cohort study, dental examiners first determined whether a clean and dry tooth surface is sound, sealed, restored, crowned, or missing. Afterwards, the examiners classified the carious status of each tooth surface using a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from sound to extensive cavitation. Histological examination of extracted teeth found increased likelihood of carious demineralization in dentin as the ICDAS codes increased in severity. The criteria were also found to have discriminatory validity in analyses of social, behavioral and dietary factors associated with dental caries. The reliability of six examiners to classify tooth surfaces by their ICDAS carious status ranged between good to excellent (kappa coefficients ranged between 0.59 and 0.82). While further work is still needed to define caries activity, validate the criteria and their reliability in assessing dental caries on smooth surfaces, and develop a classification system for assessing preventive and restorative treatment needs, this early evaluation of the ICDAS platform has found that the system is practical; has content validity, correlational validity with histological examination of pits and fissures in extracted teeth; and discriminatory validity.');

In the target-population analysis, the increase in alteplase use in intervention hospitals (59 [1Â·00%] of 5882 to 191 [2Â·62%] of 7288) was significantly greater than in control hospitals (65 [1Â·09%] of 5957 to 120 [1Â·72%] of 6989; RR 1Â·68, 95% CI 1Â·09-2Â·57; p=0Â·02), but was still clinically modest.The intervention did not significantly increase alteplase use in patients with ischaemic stroke. The increase in use of alteplase in the target population was significant, but smaller than the effect to which the study was powered.

The slopes of the O-E CUSUM provide direct estimates of the relative risk (as compared to a standard or expected failure rate) for the data being monitored. Appropriate rejection regions are obtained by controlling the false alarm rate (type I error) over a period of given length.

However, most models for predicting liver fibrosis are complicated and separate formulas are needed to predict significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. The aim of our study was to construct one simple model consisting of routine laboratory data to predict both significant fibrosis and cirrhosis among patients with CHC. Consecutive treatment-naive CHC patients who underwent liver biopsy over a 25-month period were divided into 2 sequential cohorts: training set (n = 192) and validation set (n = 78). The best model for predicting both significant fibrosis (Ishak score > or = 3) and cirrhosis in the training set included platelets, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase with an area under ROC curves (AUC) of 0.82 and 0.92, respectively. A novel index, AST to platelet ratio index (APRI), was developed to amplify the opposing effects of liver fibrosis on AST and platelet count. The AUC of APRI for predicting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis were 0.80 and 0.89, respectively, in the training set. Using optimized cut-off values, significant fibrosis could be predicted accurately in 51% and cirrhosis in 81% of patients. The AUC of APRI for predicting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in the validation set were 0.88 and 0.94, respectively. In conclusion, our study showed that a simple index using readily available laboratory results can identify CHC patients with significant fibrosis and cirrhosis with a high degree of accuracy. Application of this index may decrease the need for staging liver biopsy specimens among CHC patients.');

This result has immediate application to estimation of a survival distribution based on current survival status at a set of monitoring times. This paper considers an extended problem of maximum likelihood estimation of a series of ''ordered'' multinomial parameters p(i)= (p(1i),p(2i),.,p(mi)) for 1 <or=i <ro=k, where ordered means that p(j1) <or=p(j2) <or=<or=p(jk) for each j with 1 <or=j <or=m-1. The data consist of k independent observations X(1),., X(k) where X(i) has a multinomial distribution with probability parameter p(i) and known index n(i)\geq 1. By making use of variants of the pool adjacent violator algorithm, we obtain a simple algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimator of p(1),., p(k), and demonstrate its convergence. The results are applied to nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of the sub-distribution functions associated with a survival time random variable with competing risks when only current status data are available (Jewell et al. 2003, Biometrika, 90, 183-197).');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2670,16526006,'In this paper, we propose a model for medical costs recorded at regular time intervals, e.g. every month, as repeated measures in the presence of a terminating event, such as death. Prior models have related monthly medical costs to time since entry, with extra costs at the final observations at the time of death. Our joint model for monthly medical costs and survival time incorporates two important new features. First, medical cost and survival may be correlated because more ''frail'' patients tend to accumulate medical costs faster and die earlier. A joint random effects model is proposed to account for the correlation between medical costs and survival by a shared random effect. Second, monthly medical costs usually increase during the time period prior to death because of the intensive care for dying patients. We present a method for estimating the pattern of cost prior to death, which is applicable if the pattern can be characterized as an additive effect that is limited to a fixed time interval, say b units of time before death. This ''turn back time'' method for censored observations censors cost data b units of time before the actual censoring time, while keeping the actual censoring time for the survival data. Time-dependent covariates can be included. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference are carried out through a Monte Carlo EM algorithm with a Metropolis-Hastings sampler in the E-step.

Relative rates of wait-listing and transplantation by State were calculated using Cox regression models, adjusted for patient demographics. There were geographic differences in access to the kidney waiting list and to a kidney transplant. Adjusted wait-list rates ranged from 37% lower to 64% higher than the national average. The living donor rate ranged from 57% lower to 166% higher, while the deceased donor transplant rate ranged from 60% lower to 150% higher than the national average. In general, States with higher wait-listing rates tended to have lower transplantation rates and States with lower wait-listing rates had higher transplant rates.

SA-SDQ scores >or= 36 for men and >or= 32 for women defined high OSA risk. Logistic regression was used to model associations with habitual snoring and high OSA risk.Among 244 patients, 37% snored habitually and 40% demonstrated high OSA risk. Independent predictors of habitual snoring included gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [odds ratio (OR), 2.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19 to 4.02] and use of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) [OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.05 to 6.72].

Implicitly, this approach entertains the idea of latent failure times and leads to discussion of a marginal distribution of the nonterminal event that is not grounded in reality. We argue that, similar to models for competing risks, latent failure times should generally be avoided in modeling such data. We note that semicompeting risks have more classically been described as an illness-death model and this formulation avoids any reference to latent times. We consider an illness-death model with shared frailty, which in its most restrictive form is identical to the semicompeting risks model that has been proposed and analyzed, but that allows for many generalizations and the simple incorporation of covariates.

The limitation arises especially when there are many confounding variables in small studies. Such is the case in the INSTINCT trial designed to investigate the effectiveness of an education program in enhancing the tPA use in stroke patients. In this article, we introduce a new randomization design, the balance match weighted (BMW) design, which applies the optimal matching with constraints technique to a prospective randomized design and aims to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the treatment effect estimator. A simulation study shows that, under various confounding scenarios, the BMW design can yield substantial reductions in the MSE for the treatment effect estimator compared to a completely randomized or matched-pair design. The BMW design is also compared with a model-based approach adjusting for the estimated propensity score and Robins-Mark-Newey E-estimation procedure in terms of efficiency and robustness of the treatment effect estimator. These investigations suggest that the BMW design is more robust and usually, although not always, more efficient than either of the approaches. The design is also seen to be robust against heterogeneous error. We illustrate these methods in proposing a design for the INSTINCT trial.');

The primary hypothesis was that antiplatelet use would not be associated with radiographic evidence of ICH after controlling for relevant confounders.Consecutive cases of thrombolysis patients treated in the emergency department (ED) were identified using multiple methods. Retrospective data were collected from four hospitals from 1996 to 2004 and 24 other hospitals from 2007 to 2010 as part of a cluster-randomized trial.

The meta-analyses combined the findings of this investigation with previous similar work and found increased unadjusted risks of radiographic ICH (absolute risk difference = 4.9%, 95% CI = 0.7% to 9%) and sICH (absolute risk difference = 4%, 95% CI = 2.3% to 5.6%). The meta-analytic adjusted OR of sICH for antiplatelet use was 1.6 (95% CI = 1.1 to 2.4).The authors did not find that preexisting antiplatelet use was associated with postthrombolysis ICH or sICH in this cohort of community treated patients. Preexisting tobacco use, younger age, and lower severity were associated with lower odds of sICH. The meta-analyses demonstrated small, but statistically significant increases in the absolute risk of radiographic ICH and sICH, along with increased odds of sICH in patients with preexisting antiplatelet use.');

Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with small-forgestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P = 0.001).Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational age. Screening pregnant women for symptoms of SDB may provide an early opportunity to identify women at risk of poor delivery outcomes.IDENTIFIER: NCT01030003.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2692,2799890,'The number of cases of transfusion-associated acquired immune deficiency syndrome (TA-AIDS) that will be seen over the next few years is difficult to estimate, because of the uncertainty about the number of persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via blood transfusion and about the duration of the incubation period from HIV infection via transfusion to diagnosis of AIDS. Presented here are a mathematical model and nonparametric and parametric statistical analyses of recent data on TA-AIDS that indicate clearly the existing estimability problems. The methods provide short-term projections of new TA-AIDS cases to be reported; the results suggest about 1100 new cases to be reported in the United States between July 1988 and June 1989 and about 1500 more between July 1989 and June 1990. Estimates of the number of eventual TA-AIDS cases to be seen are considerably more uncertain and require additional assumptions about the incubation distribution. Under the assumption that the probability of an infected person developing AIDS within 8 years of infection is 0.40 (an estimation derived from cohort studies in homosexual men and hemophiliacs), parametric and nonparametric analyses give, respectively, point estimates of 14,300 and 15,000 for the number of eventual cases of AIDS (in the age group 13-69) attributable to infection by blood transfusion prior to July 1985. The parametric analysis gives a corresponding 95 percent confidence interval.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2693,3353602,'Data related to life histories of individuals can be obtained in many different ways, and the usefulness of multi-state models for statistical analysis is generally highly dependent on the type and nature of the data. In this paper, we focus on this, and present an approach to estimation for certain ''difficult'' situations associated with retrospective or incomplete prospective observation. The paper begins with the identification of some problem areas in the analysis of data on life history processes. We discuss maximum likelihood estimation in some simple contexts and introduce a pseudo-likelihood which enables the simple analysis of some sampling procedures. This approach is illustrated on standard retrospective and case-cohort designs.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2695,373811,'Distinct problems in the analysis of failure times with competing causes of failure include the estimation of treatment or exposure effects on specific failure types, the study of interrelations among failure types, and the estimation of failure rates for some causes given the removal of certain other failure types. The usual formation of these problems is in terms of conceptual or latent failure times for each failure type. This approach is criticized on the basis of unwarranted assumptions, lack of physical interpretation and identifiability problems. An alternative approach utilizing cause-specific hazard functions for observable quantities, including time-dependent covariates, is proposed. Cause-specific hazard functions are shown to be the basic estimable quantities in the competing risks framework. A method, involving the estimation of parameters that relate time-dependent risk indicators for some causes to cause-specific hazard functions for other causes, is proposed for the study of interrelations among failure types. Further, it is argued that the problem of estimation of failure rates under the removal of certain causes is not well posed until a mechanism for cause removal is specified. Following such a specification, one will sometimes be in a position to make sensible extrapolations from available data to situations involving cause removal. A clinical program in bone marrow transplantation for leukemia provides a setting for discussion and illustration of each of these ideas. Failure due to censoring in a survivorship study leads to further discussion.');

A multistate model for disease development and death is considered and an algorithm of the EM type for maximum likelihood estimation is obtained. Questions of identifiability and estimability are addressed. Under the model, interval hazards for disease occurrence are identifiable for intervals defined by the sacrifice times. A score test is developed appropriate for the comparison of two groups with respect to disease development without need of any assumption concerning lethality of the disease concerned.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2697,497336,'Many problems, particularly in medical research, concern the relationship between certain covariates and the time to occurrence of an event. The hazard or failure rate function provides a conceptually simple representation of time to occurrence data that readily adapts to include such generalizations as competing risks and covariates that vary with time. Two partially parametric models for the hazard function are considered. These are the proportional hazards model of Cox (1972) and the class of log-linear or accelerated failure time models. A synthesis of the literature on estimation from these models under prospective sampling indicates that, although important advances have occurred during the past decade, further effort is warranted on such topics as distribution theory, tests of fit, robustness, and the full utilization of a methodology that permits non-standard features. It is further argued that a good deal of fruitful research could be done on applying the same models under a variety of other sampling schemes. A discussion of estimation from case-control studies illustrates this point.');

Two hundred thirty patients with leukemia and seventy-eight patients with aplastic anemia received allogeneic HLA-identical sibling marrow. Twenty-four patients with leukemia received syngeneic marrow. The conditioning regimen prior to marrow infusion consisted of 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide and 9.2-15.75 Gy total-body irradiation (leukemia) or 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (aplastic anemia). The patients were skin-tested with the neoantigens dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and a battery of five recall antigens around 100, 150, 365, 730, 1095, 1460, and 1825 days after grafting. A binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the factors thought to influence immunocompetence. At 3 months postgrafting, the proportion of patients positive to DNCB was equal to that of normal marrow donors, but thereafter it was lower until 2 years. The proportion of patients positive to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was lower than normal regardless of the time after grafting. The proportion of patients positive to recall antigens was lower than that of normal marrow donors until 4 years after grafting. Patients with a history of acute graft-versus-host disease had the lowest probability of a positive reaction to recall antigens. None of the other factors was significantly associated with an increased or reduced level of response.');

These include methods that compare risk factor levels among diagnostic categories and methods that relate risk factor levels to age at diagnosis, with a single diagnostic category.

It is argued that methods to identify risk factors using data on a single diagnostic category involve such strong assumptions that they have limited usefulness. Analyses that compare risk factor levels among diagnostic categories, on the other hand, should continue to play an important role in epidemiologic research, though there are important limitations in relation to analyses involving disease-free controls.');

INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2701,8672708,'This note discusses the statistical analysis of tumor prevalence data arising from tumorgenicity experiments with focus on the comparison of different treatments. In this situation, the commonly used tests can be classified into two types: interval-based tests and model-based tests (Hoel, D. G. and Walburg, H. E., 1972, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 49, 361-372; Dinse, G. E. and Lagakos, S. W. 1983, Applied Statistics 32, 236-248). It is known that the results obtained from the interval-based tests may vary according to the choice of intervals and, for the model-based tests, it may be difficult to justify the assumed model. A computationally simple alternative to these tests is proposed; this alternative is not interval-based and makes no strong model assumption. The results of a simulation study comparing the proposed test with other tests are presented and suggest that the proposed approach is quite satisfactory.');
INSERT INTO "abstracts" VALUES(2702,9384646,'In the development of many diseases there are often associated variables which continuously measure the progress of an individual towards the final expression of the disease (failure). Such variables are stochastic processes, here called marker processes, and, at a given point in time, they may provide information about the current hazard and subsequently on the remaining time to failure. Here we consider a simple additive model for the relationship between the hazard function at time t and the history of the marker process up until time t. We develop some basic calculations based on this model. Interest is focused on statistical applications for markers related to estimation of the survival distribution of time to failure, including (i) the use of markers as surrogate responses for failure with censored data, and (ii) the use of markers as predictors of the time elapsed since onset of a survival process in prevalent individuals. Particular attention is directed to potential gains in efficiency incurred by using marker process information.');

Implicit in these analyses is the assumption that these effects are identical.

Consideration of between- and within-cluster effects also helps to explain observed and theoretical differences between mixture model analyses and those based on conditional likelihood methods. In particular, we show that conditional likelihood methods estimate purely within-cluster covariate effects, whereas mixture model approaches estimate a weighted average of between- and within-cluster covariate effects.');
